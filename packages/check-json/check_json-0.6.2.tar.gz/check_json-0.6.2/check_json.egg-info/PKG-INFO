check_json
===========

Check_json is a [Nagios]/[Icinga2] plugin for monitoring JSON files and URIs with [Jq] filters.

Requires Python 3.6+

# Installation

You can install with [pip]:

```sh
python3 -m pip install check-json
```

Or install from source:

```sh
git clone https://gitlab.com/cspeterson/check_json.git check_json.git
pip install check_json.git
```

# Usage

Pass the plugin any number of Jq filters (with thresholds) and a JSON source. The source can be either a file or an HTTP/S URI.

Essentially, any valid Jq filter you can formulate that returns a numerical value for comparison against its thresholds will work.

The plugin will test the result of each filter against its thresholds and report accordingly.

```sh
# usage: check_json [-h] [--filter LABEL FILTER THRESHOLDS] [--verbose] jsonsrc
check_json  --filter 'LABEL1' 'FILTER1' 'wRANGE,cRANGE'  --filter 'LABEL2' 'FILTER2' 'wRANGE,cRANGE'  /path/to/jsonsrc
```

For example, this will warn if the value of `key` is more than 10, and will crit if it is more than 20:

```sh
check_json --filter 'my_label' '.key' 'w~:10,c~:20'
```

Or to report numerical `{1,0}` for perfdata if a string is present:

```sh
check_json --filter 'my_label' 'if .key == "some_string" then 1 else 0 end' 'w10,c20'
```

For more on Jq filters, refer to the [JQ Manual] for your version of `libjq`.

For more on Nagios plugin ranges, thresholds, perfdata, and return codes, see [Nagios Plugin Development Guidelines].

## Icinga2

Here is an Icinga2 `CheckCommand` object for this plugin:

```
object CheckCommand "check_json" {
  command = [ PluginDir + "/check_json", ]
  arguments = {
    # It appears the only way to get Icinga to repeat a particular key *and*
    # pass it multiple separate arguments is to define it multiple times (as
    # below), give them all the same key, and just increment the number for
    # each subsequent usage of the key ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
    "--filter" = {
      description = "Defines a filter, its name, and thresholds."
      key = "--filter"
      repeat_key = false
      value = "$check_json_filter$"
    }
    "--filter0" = {
      description = "Defines a filter, its name, and thresholds."
      key = "--filter"
      repeat_key = false
      value = "$check_json_filter0$"
    }
    "--filter1" = {
      description = "Defines a filter, its name, and thresholds."
      key = "--filter"
      repeat_key = false
      value = "$check_json_filter1$"
    }
    "--filter2" = {
      description = "Defines a filter, its name, and thresholds."
      key = "--filter"
      repeat_key = false
      value = "$check_json_filter2$"
    }
    "--filter3" = {
      description = "Defines a filter, its name, and thresholds."
      key = "--filter"
      repeat_key = false
      value = "$check_json_filter3$"
    }
    "--filter4" = {
      description = "Defines a filter, its name, and thresholds."
      key = "--filter"
      repeat_key = false
      value = "$check_json_filter4$"
    }
    "--filter5" = {
      description = "Defines a filter, its name, and thresholds."
      key = "--filter"
      repeat_key = false
      value = "$check_json_filter5$"
    }
    "--filter6" = {
      description = "Defines a filter, its name, and thresholds."
      key = "--filter"
      repeat_key = false
      value = "$check_json_filter6$"
    }
    jsonsrc = {
      description = "The path to the file to inspect"
      required = true
      skip_key = true
      value = "$check_json_jsonsrc$"
    }
  }
}
```

And a minimal example Icinga Service:

```
object Service "host.domain.tld_check" {
  import "generic-service"
  display_name = "Jq JSON filter"
  host_name = "host.domain.tld"
  check_command = "check_json"
  command_endpoint = "host.domain.tld"
  notes = "The `check_json` command is a custom plugin to run Jq filters against JSON files."
  notes_url = "https://gitlab.com/cspeterson/check_json"

  vars.check_json_filter = ["mylabel1". ".somefilter1", "w@0"]
  vars.check_json_filter2 = ["mylabel2". ".somefilter2", "w@0"]
  vars.check_json_jsonfile = "/path/to/file.json"
}
```

Note: on the command path: the preceeding Icinga2 configuration object points to the `check_json` command in Icinga2's configured `PluginDir`, but this can be configured however you like. For instance:

* point it to wherever it is installed by its full path
* symlink from the specified path to the actual script.
* or take the kludge route, leave it as-is, and copy `check_json/__main__.py` from this repo into `PluginDir + "/check_json"`

Up to you!

# Limitations

What this plugin is *not* for:

* Exceptionally huge JSON files - this plugin loads the entire JSON file into memory.
* Keeping place in a log file over time. For that (though with admittedly simpler pattern matching), see [check_logfiles].

# Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

To run the test suite:

```bash
# `all` includes venv creation and installation of dependencies
make all
```

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
