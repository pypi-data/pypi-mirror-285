I'm heading to Paris on Monday and I need your help finding a restaurant that's open on Mondays, serves Chinese food, and won't break the bank (under 34 euros per person).\n            Can you suggest a restaurant with the best rating and reviews.\n            Also, I'm looking for a car rental company with prices under 50 euros. Could you recommend a few options and let me know which one has the best rating?\n            Please share the names of the recommended restaurant and car rental company.

Additionally, she's looking for a car rental company with prices under 50 euros and wants to know which one has the best rating. To achieve this, I'll need to call the `get_all_restaurants_in_city` function to get a list of restaurants in Paris, then filter them by cuisine, day of the week, and price range. After that, I can use the `get_rating_reviews_for_restaurants` function to get the ratings and reviews of the filtered restaurants. For the car rental companies, I'll call the `get_all_car_rental_companies_in_city` function to get a list of companies in Paris, then filter them by price range.
