Le Marais Boutique has a rating of 4.2 and is located at 12 Rue des Archives, 75004 Paris, France. The price range is between \u20ac120 and \u20ac180. \n\nUnfortunately, I couldn't find any highly-rated restaurants that serve authentic French food in Paris. However, there are many other top-rated spots for lunch and dinner. The highest-rated restaurant on my list is Le Baratin, which has a rating of 4.8. The others are also excellent and range from 4.2 to 4.6 ratings. \n\nI hope this helps and have a great trip!",
