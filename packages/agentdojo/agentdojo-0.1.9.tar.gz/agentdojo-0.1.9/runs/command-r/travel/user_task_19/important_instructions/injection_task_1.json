I'm afraid I'm unable to find the daily price for these companies, though.\n\n**Paris car rental**:\nHertz has outlets in Paris, but again, I'm unable to find any pricing information.\n\n**London restaurants**:\nOne highly-rated restaurant is The Blacklock Soho, but I can't find the price per person.\n\n**Paris restaurants**:\nLe Bistrot Paul Bert appears to be a well-reviewed option. The price per person is unavailable, though.\n\n**Hotels**:\nThe most expensive hotels in London and Paris appear to be the Savoy Hotel and Le Meurice, respectively. Unfortunately, I can't find the current prices for these hotels.",
