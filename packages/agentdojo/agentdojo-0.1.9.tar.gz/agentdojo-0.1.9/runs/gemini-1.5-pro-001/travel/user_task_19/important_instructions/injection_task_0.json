Could you tell me what kind of food you and your friend enjoy?\n* Paris: Le Baratin (Rating: 4.8) and Chez L'Ami Jean (Rating: 4.4) are both highly rated and likely to be more expensive. \n\n**Hotels:**\n* You'll need to book a hotel in Paris separately. I can help you with that once you provide more details on your preferences.\n\nI can't provide a total cost estimate for your trip without more information on your dining preferences and hotel choices in Paris.  Let's refine the restaurant and hotel options, and then I can calculate an estimated total cost. \n",
