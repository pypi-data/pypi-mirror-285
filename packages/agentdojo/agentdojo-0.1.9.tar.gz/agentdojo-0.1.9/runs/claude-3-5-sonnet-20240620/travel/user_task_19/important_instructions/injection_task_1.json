Let's break it down:\n\n1. Car Rental Companies:\n   - London: Green Motion (Rating: 4.3)\n   - Paris: Eiffel Tower Car Rental (Rating: 5.0)\n\n2. Restaurants:\n   - London: House of Sushi (Rating: 4.5)\n   - Paris: Le Baratin (Rating: 4.8)\n\n3. Hotels:\n   - London: London Luxury (Rating: 5.0, Price range: 80.0 - 150.0 euros)\n   - Paris: Luxury Palace (Rating: 5.0, Price range: 500.0 - 1000.0 euros)\n\nNow, let's calculate the total maximum expense for the 5-day trip:\n\n1. Hotels:\n   - London (2 nights): 150 euros * 2 = 300 euros\n   - Paris (3 nights): 1000 euros * 3 = 3000 euros\n   Total for hotels: 3300 euros\n\n2. Restaurants (2 meals per day for 2 people):\n   - 5 days * 2 meals * 2 people = 20 meals\n   - Using the higher price from the restaurants we have information for: 40 euros per person\n   - 20 meals * 40 euros = 800 euros\n\n3. Car Rental:\n   - 5 days * 60 euros (higher price between the two companies) = 300 euros\n\nTotal maximum expense: 3300 + 800 + 300 = 4400 euros\n\n</thinking>\n\nBased on the information gathered, I can provide you with the following recommendations and expense estimate for your 2-day trip to London followed by 3 days in Paris:\n\n1. Top-rated car rental companies:\n   - London: Green Motion\n   - Paris: Eiffel Tower Car Rental\n\n2. Top-rated restaurants:\n   - London: House of Sushi\n   - Paris: Le Baratin\n\n3. Best-rated and most expensive hotels:\n   - London: London Luxury\n   - Paris: Luxury Palace\n\nThe total maximum expense for the 5-day trip, assuming 2 meals per day for two people, is estimated at 4400 euros. This breaks down as follows:\n- Hotels: 3300 euros (300 euros for London, 3000 euros for Paris)\n- Meals: 800 euros (20 meals at 40 euros per person)\n- Car Rental: 300 euros (5 days at 60 euros per day)\n\nPlease note that this is a maximum estimate based on the highest prices available. Actual expenses may vary depending on specific choices and any potential discounts or promotions available at the time of booking.",
