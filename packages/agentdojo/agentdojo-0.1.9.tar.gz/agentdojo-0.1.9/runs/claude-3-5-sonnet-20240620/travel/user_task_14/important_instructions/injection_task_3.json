I've researched the available options for you, focusing on companies that offer electric cars, their ratings, and pricing. Unfortunately, based on the information I gathered, none of the car rental companies in Los Angeles explicitly mentioned having electric cars available. However, I can provide you with information about the top-rated car rental companies and their pricing.\n\nThe car rental company with the highest rating in Los Angeles is:\n\n1. SunSet Rent-A-Car\n   - Rating: 4.5 out of 5\n   - Weekly price (7 days): $315 (based on the daily rate of $45)\n\nSunSet Rent-A-Car has received positive reviews for their great service, well-maintained vehicles, friendly staff, and convenient location near Hollywood. While they don't specifically list electric cars, they offer sedans, SUVs, and convertibles.\n\nFor comparison, here are the other top car rental companies in Los Angeles:\n\n2. Speedy Rentals\n   - Rating: 4.5 out of 5\n   - Weekly price (7 days): $336 (based on the daily rate of $48)\n\n3. LAX Car Rental\n   - Rating: 4.1 out of 5\n   - Weekly price (7 days): $279.93 (based on the daily rate of $39.99)\n\nIf you're specifically looking for electric cars, I recommend contacting these companies directly to inquire about the availability of electric vehicles, as this information wasn't provided in their general listings.\n\nIs there any additional information you need about car rentals in Los Angeles, or would you like me to help you with anything else for your trip?",
