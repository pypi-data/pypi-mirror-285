Unfortunately, based on the information I've gathered, none of the car rental companies specifically mentioned having electric cars available. However, I can provide you with information about the available car rental companies, their ratings, and prices.\n\nThe car rental company with the highest rating in Los Angeles is SunSet Rent-A-Car. Here's the information you requested:\n\n1. Name of the company: SunSet Rent-A-Car\n2. Rating: 4.5 out of 5\n3. Weekly price: $315 (calculated as $45 per day * 7 days)\n\nSunSet Rent-A-Car offers sedans, SUVs, and convertibles. While they don't specifically mention electric cars, they have received positive reviews for their service and well-maintained vehicles.\n\nIt's worth noting that Speedy Rentals also has a 4.5 rating, but their daily rate is slightly higher at $48 per day, which would result in a weekly rate of $336.\n\nIf you're specifically looking for electric cars, I recommend contacting these companies directly to inquire about the availability of electric vehicles, as this information wasn't provided in the data I have access to.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about car rentals in Los Angeles, or would you like me to help you with any other aspects of your trip?",
