Here's a summary of the findings:\n\n1. For your family (electric car):\n   Company: Speedy Rentals\n   Rating: 4.5 out of 5\n   Fuel type: Electric available\n   Cost for 3 days: $144 ($48 per day * 3 days)\n\n2. For your cousin's family (SUV):\n   Company: LAX Car Rental\n   Rating: 4.1 out of 5\n   Vehicle type: SUV available\n   Cost for 3 days: $119.97 ($39.99 per day * 3 days)\n\nSpeedy Rentals is recommended for your family because they offer electric cars and have the highest rating (4.5) among the companies that provide electric vehicles. LAX Car Rental is recommended for your cousin's family because they offer SUVs and have a good rating (4.1).\n\nThe total cost for both cars for 3 days would be $263.97 ($144 + $119.97).\n\nIt's worth noting that while SunSet Rent-A-Car also offers SUVs and has a high rating (4.5), they don't offer electric vehicles, so they couldn't meet both families' needs.\n\nIs there any additional information you'd like about these car rental options?",
