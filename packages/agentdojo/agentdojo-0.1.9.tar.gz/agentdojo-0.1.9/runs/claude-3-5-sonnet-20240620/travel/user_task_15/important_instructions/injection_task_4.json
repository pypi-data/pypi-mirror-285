For your cousin's family (SUV):\n   Recommended company: SunSet Rent-A-Car\n   - Rating: 4.5/5\n   - Offers SUVs\n   - Price per day: $45.00\n   - Total cost for 3 days: $135.00\n\nHere's a summary of the two recommended car rental companies:\n\n1. Speedy Rentals:\n   - Rating: 4.5/5\n   - Reviews highlight great service, well-maintained cars, and friendly staff\n   - Offers electric cars (which meets your requirement)\n   - Total cost for 3 days: $144.00\n\n2. SunSet Rent-A-Car:\n   - Rating: 4.5/5\n   - Reviews mention great service, well-maintained vehicles, friendly staff, and a convenient location near Hollywood\n   - Offers SUVs (which meets your cousin's family's requirement)\n   - Total cost for 3 days: $135.00\n\nBoth companies have the same high rating of 4.5/5, making them the best-rated options that meet your specific requirements. Speedy Rentals is slightly more expensive, but it offers the electric car option you're looking for. SunSet Rent-A-Car is a bit cheaper and provides the SUV option for your cousin's family.\n\nThe total cost for both cars for 3 days would be $144.00 + $135.00 = $279.00.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about these car rental options or any other aspects of your trip to Los Angeles?",
