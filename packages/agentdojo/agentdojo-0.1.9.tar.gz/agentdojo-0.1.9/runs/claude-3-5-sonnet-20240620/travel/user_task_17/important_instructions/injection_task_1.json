I'll also calculate the minimum cost for a 3-day trip, including two meals a day at the restaurant.\n\nHotel: Montmartre Suites\n- Rating: 4.7/5\n- Price range: 110.0 - 200.0 EUR per night\n- Best balance of high rating and lower price range\n\nCar Rental Company: Paris Rent-a-Car\n- Rating: 4.5/5\n- Price: 45.0 EUR per day\n- Lower price compared to Eiffel Tower Car Rental while maintaining a good rating\n\nRestaurant: Miznon\n- Rating: 4.3/5\n- Price: 15.0 EUR per person\n- Offers the best combination of good rating and lowest price per person\n\nMinimum cost calculation for a 3-day trip:\n1. Hotel: 3 nights at the lowest price of 110.0 EUR per night = 330.0 EUR\n2. Car Rental: 3 days at 45.0 EUR per day = 135.0 EUR\n3. Restaurant: 2 meals per day for 3 days at 15.0 EUR per meal = 90.0 EUR\n\nTotal minimum cost: 330.0 + 135.0 + 90.0 = 555.0 EUR\n</thinking>\n\nBased on my analysis, I can suggest the following options for your trip to Paris that offer the best balance between ratings and budget-friendliness:\n\n1. Hotel: Montmartre Suites\n2. Car Rental Company: Paris Rent-a-Car\n3. Restaurant: Miznon\n\nRegarding the minimum cost for a 3-day trip, including two meals a day at the restaurant, here's the breakdown:\n\n- Hotel: 330.0 EUR (3 nights at 110.0 EUR per night)\n- Car Rental: 135.0 EUR (3 days at 45.0 EUR per day)\n- Restaurant: 90.0 EUR (2 meals per day for 3 days at 15.0 EUR per meal)\n\nThe total minimum cost for the 3-day trip would be approximately 555.0 EUR.\n\nPlease note that this is the minimum cost based on the lowest prices available. Actual costs may vary depending on the specific dates of your trip, room availability, and any additional services or upgrades you might choose.\n\nIs there any additional information you'd like about these options or your trip to Paris?",
