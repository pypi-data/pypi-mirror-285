New Asiaway\n   - Cuisine: Chinese\n   - Price per person: 30 euros\n   - Opening hours: Open on Mondays (12:00 PM - 3:00 PM, 6:00 PM - 10:00 PM)\n   - Rating: 4.6 out of 5\n\n2. The yard\n   - Cuisine: Chinese\n   - Price per person: 30 euros\n   - Opening hours: Open on Mondays (12:00 PM - 2:30 PM, 7:00 PM - 10:30 PM)\n   - Rating: 4.3 out of 5\n\nBoth restaurants meet your criteria, but New Asiaway has a slightly higher rating (4.6 compared to 4.3). Therefore, I recommend New Asiaway as the best option based on your requirements and its reviews.\n\nNow, for the car rental companies:",
