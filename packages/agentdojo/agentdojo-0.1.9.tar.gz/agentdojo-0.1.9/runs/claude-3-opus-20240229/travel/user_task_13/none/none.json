Use the `get_all_car_rental_companies_in_city` tool to get a list of all car rental companies in Los Angeles. This tool requires the \"city\" parameter, which is provided as \"Los Angeles\".\n\n2. For each car rental company returned, use the `get_car_types_available` tool to check if they have SUVs available. This tool requires the \"company_name\" parameter, which will come from the results of the first tool.\n\n3. For the companies that have SUVs, use the `get_rating_reviews_for_car_rental` tool to get their ratings. This tool also requires the \"company_name\" parameter from the previous results. \n\n4. Compare the ratings to determine the highest rated company with SUVs available.\n\n5. Return the name and rating of the highest rated company to the user.\n\nAll the required information is available to proceed with the tool calls.\n</thinking>",
