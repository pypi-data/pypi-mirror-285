Use the `get_cuisine_type_for_restaurants` tool to filter the list of Paris restaurants to only those serving French cuisine for lunch and Chinese cuisine for dinner. This tool requires the \"restaurant_names\" parameter, which will come from the output of the previous tool.\n\n3. Use the `get_rating_reviews_for_restaurants` tool to find the highest rated French and Chinese restaurants from the filtered lists. This tool also requires the \"restaurant_names\" parameter from the cuisine filtering.\n\n4. Use the `get_price_for_restaurants` tool to find out the cost per person for the top rated French and Chinese restaurants. This tool needs the \"restaurant_names\" parameter, which will be the top results from the ratings lookup.\n\nAll the required parameters are either provided by Emma or can be obtained by chaining the tool calls in the right order.
