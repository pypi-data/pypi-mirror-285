Filter the list of restaurants to only those serving Chinese cuisine using the `get_cuisine_type_for_restaurants` tool. This requires the list of restaurant names from step 1.\n\n3. For the Chinese restaurants, check their opening hours using `check_restaurant_opening_hours` to see which ones are open on Monday. This requires the list of Chinese restaurant names from step 2.\n\n4. For the Chinese restaurants open on Monday, get their price per person using `get_price_for_restaurants`. Filter to only those with prices under 34 euros. This requires the list of restaurant names open on Monday from step 3.\n\n5. For the remaining restaurants meeting all criteria so far, get their ratings and reviews using `get_rating_reviews_for_restaurants`. Determine which one has the best rating. This requires the restaurant names from step 4.\n\n6. For the top rated restaurant, get its address using `get_restaurants_address`.
