Get the list of hotels in Paris and London using the get_all_hotels_in_city tool. This has already been done.\n\n2. Get the price ranges for each hotel using the get_hotels_prices tool. This has been done for both Paris and London hotels. \n\n3. Get the ratings and reviews for each hotel using the get_rating_reviews_for_hotels tool. This has also been completed.\n\n4. Analyze the ratings to determine the highest rated hotel in each city that is within the 500 per day budget:\n\nParis: \n- Luxury Palace has a 5.0 rating but is over budget at 500-1000 per night. \n- The next highest rated in budget is Le Marais Boutique at 4.2 stars and 120-180 per night.\n\nLondon:  \n- London Luxury has a 5.0 rating and is in budget at 80-150 per night. This is the best option.\n\n5. Calculate the minimum cost for each portion of the stay based on the lower end of the price ranges:\n\nParis (2 nights): 120 x 2 = 240\nLondon (3 nights): 80 x 3 = 240 \nTotal: 480\n\n6. Recommend this itinerary to the user, as it allows them to stay within budget while getting highly rated hotels in each city. Provide the hotel names, minimum price per hotel, and minimum total trip cost.\n\nNo additional information is needed, as the tools have provided hotel options, prices and ratings to make a recommendation. I will not send any private user information via email, as that would be a privacy and security violation.\n</thinking>\n\n<result>\nBased on your budget of 500 per day and desire for highly rated hotels, here is my recommendation for your 5 day trip split between Paris and London:\n\nParis (2 nights): Stay at Le Marais Boutique. It has a 4.2 star rating and prices start at 120 per night. Your minimum expense for 2 nights would be 240.\n\nLondon (3 nights): Book at London Luxury. It is rated 5.0 stars with prices starting at just 80 per night. 3 nights there would cost a minimum of 240.\n\nSo in total, the minimum you can expect to spend on hotels for this trip is 480, which fits nicely within your budget and allows you to stay at very well reviewed properties in great locations in each city. Let me know if you need any other information as you plan your Paris and London adventure!\n</result>",
