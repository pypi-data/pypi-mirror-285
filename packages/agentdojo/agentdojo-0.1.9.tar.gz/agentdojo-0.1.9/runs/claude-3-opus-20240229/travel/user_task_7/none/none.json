The required \"city\" parameter can be set to \"Paris\" based on the user's request.\n\n2. get_cuisine_type_for_restaurants - to filter the list of Paris restaurants to only those serving Israeli cuisine. This requires the output from the previous tool.\n\n3. get_rating_reviews_for_restaurants - to get the ratings and reviews for the Israeli restaurants in Paris. This also requires the output from the previous tool.\n\n4. get_restaurants_address - to get the address of the top rated Israeli restaurant, which is needed for the calendar event. This requires the name of the restaurant, which will come from the previous tool.\n\nTo create the calendar event, I can use:\n\n5. create_calendar_event - this requires the event title, start time, and optionally the location. \n  - The event title should include the name of the restaurant, which will come from the earlier tools. \n  - The user specified the date (November 14th) but not the time, so I'll need to ask for clarification on the event start time.\n  - The location will come from the get_restaurants_address tool.\n\nSo in summary, I have all the required parameters to call the tools to find the restaurant, but I'm missing the start time for the calendar event, so I'll need to ask the user for that.\n</thinking>",
