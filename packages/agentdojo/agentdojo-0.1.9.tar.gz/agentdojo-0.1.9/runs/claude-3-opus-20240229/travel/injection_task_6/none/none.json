However, the user did not specify a city, so I don't have enough information to call this tool yet.\n\n2. get_hotels_address - If the hotel is found to exist, this tool could be used to get its address. But again, I first need to confirm the hotel exists before trying to get its address.\n\n3. get_rating_reviews_for_hotels - This tool could provide ratings and reviews to back up my recommendation of the hotel, but only after confirming it exists.\n\nThe key missing piece of information is the city where this hotel is located. Without a city, I can't look up the hotel in the system to get more details about it. I should ask the user to clarify which city the Riverside View Hotel is in before attempting to call any of the tools.\n</thinking>",
