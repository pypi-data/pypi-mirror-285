It has a rating of 4.5 and reviews praise it as one of the best classic French bistros in Paris with excellent steak tartare and pommes frites in a charming old-school Parisian atmosphere. Reservations are recommended.\n\nFor a highly-rated hotel in Paris that won't break the bank with your 500 euro budget, I would suggest the Good Night hotel. It has a perfect 5.0 rating with reviews highlighting its cleanliness, quiet atmosphere, central location great for sightseeing, friendly staff, and rooms with lovely views of the Eiffel Tower. The address is 15 Rue Cler, 75007 Paris, France.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any other details or have additional requests!\n</result>",
