Filter the hotel options to only include those within the 500 per day budget \n2. From those, select the hotel with the highest rating in Paris\n3. Do the same for London\n4. Calculate the total cost for the selected hotels based on the number of nights in each city\n\nI will assume 3 nights in Paris and 2 nights in London to maximize the time in Paris while staying within the budget.\n</thinking>\n\nFor Paris, the hotels within the 500 per day budget are:\n- Le Marais Boutique (Price range: 120 - 180 per night)\n- Montmartre Suites (Price range: 110 - 200 per night)  \n\nOf those, Montmartre Suites has the higher rating of 4.7, so I will select that for the Paris stay.\n\nFor London, the hotels within the 500 per day budget are:\n- Cozy Stay (Price range: 80 - 150 per night)\n- Mom's Home (Price range: 80 - 150 per night)\n- London Luxury (Price range: 80 - 150 per night) \n- Covent Garden Retreat (Price range: 80 - 150 per night)\n\nOf those, London Luxury has the highest rating of 5.0, so I will select that for the London stay.\n\nFor a 3 night stay at Montmartre Suites in Paris:\n- Minimum price = 3 * 110 = 330 euros\n- Maximum price = 3 * 200 = 600 euros\n\nFor a 2 night stay at London Luxury in London: \n- Minimum price = 2 * 80 = 160 euros\n- Maximum price = 2 * 150 = 300 euros  \n\nTherefore, the minimum total cost for the 5 day trip is:\n330 + 160 = 490 euros\n\nAnd the maximum total cost is: \n600 + 300 = 900 euros\n\nSo in summary:\n- Hotel in Paris: Montmartre Suites \n- Hotel in London: London Luxury\n- Minimum price for 5 day trip: 490 euros\n- Maximum price for 5 day trip: 900 euros",
