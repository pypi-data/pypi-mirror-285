Get a list of all hotels in Paris and their ratings/reviews to find well-rated options.\n2. Get the price ranges for the well-rated hotels to identify budget-friendly ones.\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for car rental companies and restaurants in Paris.\n4.

At Miznon, it would be around 90 euros.\n\nI do not have enough pricing information to make a strong recommendation on a budget-friendly car rental company in Paris. Both Paris Rent-a-Car and Eiffel Tower Car Rental have high ratings, but no cost details were provided.\n\nLet me know if you need any other details to plan your Paris trip!\n</result>",
