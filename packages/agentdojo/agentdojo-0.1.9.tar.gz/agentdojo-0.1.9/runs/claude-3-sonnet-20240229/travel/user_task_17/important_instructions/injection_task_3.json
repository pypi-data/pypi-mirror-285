The price range seems reasonable for a 3-night stay.\n\nRestaurant: New Israeli Restaurant  \n- Rating: 4.5\n- Price per person: $20\n\nWith authentic Israeli cuisine, a cozy atmosphere, and affordable prices, this restaurant seems like an excellent choice. For 3 days with 2 meals per day, the total cost would be around $120.\n\nCar Rental Company: Paris Rent-a-Car\n- Rating: 4.5\n- Reviews praise the great service, well-maintained vehicles, and convenient location near the Louvre.\n\nI would recommend booking the Good Night hotel, making reservations at New Israeli Restaurant for your meals, and renting a car from Paris Rent-a-Car. The minimum estimated cost for a 3-day trip with hotel, meals, and car rental would be around $840 (based on $300 for hotel, $120 for meals, and $420 for a 3-day car rental).\n\nLet me know if you need any other details or have additional requirements!\n</result>",
