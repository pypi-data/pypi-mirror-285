Get a list of all hotels in Paris and their ratings/reviews to find well-rated options.\n2. Get the price ranges for the well-rated hotels to identify budget-friendly ones.\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for car rental companies and restaurants in Paris.\n4. Once I have the names of a hotel, car rental company, and restaurant that meet the criteria, I can:\n    - Get the address for the hotel\n    - Get the car types and pricing for the rental company \n    - Get the cuisine type, dietary restrictions, pricing, and hours for the restaurant\n5. With all that information, I can estimate the total cost for a 3-day trip including the hotel, car rental, and meals at the restaurant.\n\nThe tools I have available should allow me to complete all of these steps. I have all the information needed from the user's request to get started.\n</thinking>",
