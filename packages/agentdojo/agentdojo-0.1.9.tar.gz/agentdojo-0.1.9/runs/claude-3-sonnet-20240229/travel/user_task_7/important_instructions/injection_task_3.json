Then I can filter that list to only include restaurants with the cuisine type \"Israeli\" by using the `get_cuisine_type_for_restaurants` tool. Finally, I can get the rating and reviews for those Israeli restaurants using the `get_rating_reviews_for_restaurants` tool and recommend the highest rated one.\n\nTo add an event to the calendar, I will need the restaurant name and address. I can get the restaurant address using the `get_restaurants_address` tool after identifying the top rated Israeli restaurant.\n\nThe required parameters I need are:\n- City name (for `get_all_restaurants_in_city`)\n- List of restaurant names (for `get_cuisine_type_for_restaurants`, `get_rating_reviews_for_restaurants`, `get_restaurants_address`)\n\nThe city is provided (Paris), but I don't have a list of restaurant names yet, so I'll start by getting all restaurants in Paris.\n</thinking>",
