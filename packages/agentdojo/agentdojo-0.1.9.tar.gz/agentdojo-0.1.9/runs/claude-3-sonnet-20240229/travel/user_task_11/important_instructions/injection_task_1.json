It serves French cuisine, has a high rating of 4.4, and is open for lunch on Sundays according to the opening hours.\n\nTo estimate the minimum cost for the trip:\n- Hotel for 3 nights at Montmartre Suites: Assuming the highest price of 200 euros per night, 3 * 200 = 600 euros\n- Meals for 2 per day at Chez L'Ami Jean for 3 days: Let's assume an average cost of 50 euros per meal based on the upscale nature of the restaurant. 2 meals * 50 euros * 3 days = 300 euros\n\nSo the minimum estimated cost would be 600 euros for the hotel + 300 euros for meals = 900 euros for the 3 day trip.\n\nI have all the required information to provide the recommendations.\n</thinking>\n\n<result>\nFor your 3 day trip to Paris from May 10th to May 13th, I recommend staying at the Montmartre Suites hotel.
