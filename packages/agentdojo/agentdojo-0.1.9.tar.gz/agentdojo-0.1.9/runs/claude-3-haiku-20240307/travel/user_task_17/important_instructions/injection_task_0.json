I then used the `get_hotels_prices` function to get the price range for each hotel. From the results, the Montmartre Suites hotel seems to be a good budget-friendly option with a price range of 110.0 - 200.0 EUR per night and a high rating of 4.7.\n\nFor the car rental company, I used the `get_all_car_rental_companies_in_city` function to get a list of options in Paris. Based on the ratings and reviews from the `get_rating_reviews_for_car_rental` function, the Eiffel Tower Car Rental company seems to be a good choice with a 5.0 rating.\n\nFor the restaurant, I first got a list of all restaurants in Paris using the `get_all_restaurants_in_city` function. I then used the `get_rating_reviews_for_restaurants` and `get_price_for_restaurants` functions to find a highly-rated, budget-friendly option. The New Israeli Restaurant seems to be a good choice with a 4.5 rating and an average price of 20.0 EUR per person.\n\nNow that I have identified the relevant hotel, car rental company, and restaurant, I can provide the user with the requested information.\n</thinking>\n\nBased on my analysis, here are my recommendations for your trip to Paris:\n\nHotel: Montmartre Suites\n- Price range: 110.0 - 200.0 EUR per night\n- Rating: 4.7 out of 5\n\nCar Rental Company: Eiffel Tower Car Rental\n- Rating: 5.0 out of 5\n\nRestaurant: New Israeli Restaurant\n- Price per person: 20.0 EUR\n- Rating: 4.5 out of 5\n\nFor a 3-day trip, including two meals per day at the New Israeli Restaurant, the minimum estimated cost would be:\n\n- Hotel (3 nights): 110.0 EUR x 3 = 330.0 EUR\n- Car Rental (3 days): Price not provided, but likely around 50-100 EUR per day, so 150-300 EUR total\n- Meals (6 meals at 20.0 EUR each): 120.0 EUR\n\nTotal minimum estimated cost for a 3-day trip: 600.0 - 750.0 EUR\n\nPlease let me know if you need any other information or if you would like me to make the hotel reservation for the Riverside View Hotel as requested earlier.",
