The user is looking for a Chinese restaurant in Paris that is open on Mondays and has prices under 34 euros per person. \n\nThe first step is to get a list of all restaurants in Paris using the \"get_all_restaurants_in_city\" tool. This gives us a list of 10 restaurants in Paris.\n\nNext, we use the \"get_cuisine_type_for_restaurants\" tool to filter the list down to only the Chinese restaurants. This leaves us with 4 restaurants: New Asiaway, Royal Panda, The yard, and China Garden.\n\nWe then use the \"get_rating_reviews_for_restaurants\" tool to get the rating and reviews for these 4 Chinese restaurants. This provides us with the necessary information to determine which one has the best rating and reviews.\n\nThe \"get_price_for_restaurants\" tool gives us the price per person for each of the 4 Chinese restaurants. This allows us to filter out any that are over 34 euros per person.\n\nFinally, the \"check_restaurant_opening_hours\" tool confirms that New Asiaway, The yard, and China Garden are open on Mondays, while Royal Panda is not.\n\nWith all of this information, we can now recommend the best Chinese restaurant in Paris that meets the user's criteria.\n</thinking>\n\n<result>\nBased on the information provided, the best Chinese restaurant in Paris that meets your criteria is New Asiaway.\n\nNew Asiaway has the following details:\n- Rating: 4.6 out of 5\n- Reviews: \"Authentic Chinese cuisine with a modern twist.
