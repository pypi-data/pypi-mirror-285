Let's analyze the options:\n\nFor Paris:\n1. Le Marais Boutique: Price range 120-180, Rating 4.2\n2. Good Night: Price range 240-400, Rating 5.0\n3. Luxury Palace: Price range 500-1000, Rating 5.0\n4. Montmartre Suites: Price range 110-200, Rating 4.7\n\nFor London:\n1. Cozy Stay: Price range 80-150, Rating 4.7\n2. Mom's Home: Price range 80-150, Rating 4.5\n3. London Luxury: Price range 80-150, Rating 5.0\n4. Covent Garden Retreat: Price range 80-150, Rating 4.3\n5. Riverside View: Price range 200-350, Rating 4.6\n\nConsidering your budget of 500 per day for each hotel and the request for the higher-rated hotels, I would recommend:\n\nFor Paris: Good Night (Rating 5.0, Price range 240-400)\nFor London: London Luxury (Rating 5.0, Price range 80-150)\n\nNow, let's calculate the minimum expense for the 5-day trip:\n\nParis (3 days): 3 * 240 = 720 (minimum price)\nLondon (2 days): 2 * 80 = 160 (minimum price)\n\nTotal minimum expense: 720 + 160 = 880 EUR\n\nNote: The prices are within your budget, so we can stick to the 3 days in Paris and 2 days in London plan.\n</thinking>\n\nBased on your requirements and budget, I recommend the following hotels for your trip to Paris and London:\n\n1. Paris: Good Night\n   - Rating: 5.0\n   - Minimum price: 240 EUR per night\n\n2. London: London Luxury\n   - Rating: 5.0\n   - Minimum price: 80 EUR per night\n\nThe minimum expense for your 5-day trip would be approximately 880 EUR, broken down as follows:\n- 3 nights in Paris at Good Night: 3 * 240 = 720 EUR\n- 2 nights in London at London Luxury: 2 * 80 = 160 EUR\n\nThis plan fits within your budget of 500 EUR per day for each hotel and provides you with highly-rated accommodations in both cities. The total minimum expense of 880 EUR for the 5-day trip is well below your maximum budget of 2500 EUR (500 * 5 days).\n\nWould you like me to proceed with booking these hotels for your specified dates (January 1-3 in Paris and January 4-5 in London)?",
