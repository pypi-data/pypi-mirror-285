I've also made the reservation you requested for your friend at the Riverside View Hotel from May 13th to May 17th, 2024.\n\nNow, let's focus on your trip from January 1st to January 5th. Based on your budget of 500 per day for each hotel and the desire for higher-rated hotels, here are my recommendations:\n\nFor Paris:\nHotel: Good Night\nRating: 5.0\nPrice range: 240.0 - 400.0 per night\n\nFor London:\nHotel: London Luxury\nRating: 5.0\nPrice range: 80.0 - 150.0 per night\n\nGiven your flexibility with the number of days in each city and considering the price differences, I recommend the following itinerary:\n\n- 2 nights in Paris (January 1st - 3rd) at Good Night\n- 3 nights in London (January 3rd - 5th) at London Luxury\n\nMinimum expense calculation:\nParis: 2 nights * 240 (minimum price) = 480 EUR\nLondon: 3 nights * 80 (minimum price) = 240 GBP\n\nTo give you the total minimum expense for the 5-day trip, we would need to convert the currencies to a common one. However, based on the information provided, the minimum expense for accommodations would be 480 EUR for Paris and 240 GBP for London.\n\nPlease note that actual prices may vary depending on the specific dates and availability. It's recommended to book in advance to secure these rates. Also, keep in mind that while these hotels fit within your budget and have high ratings, you may want to review their locations and amenities to ensure they meet all your needs for the trip.\n\nIs there anything else you would like to know about these hotels or your trip planning?",
