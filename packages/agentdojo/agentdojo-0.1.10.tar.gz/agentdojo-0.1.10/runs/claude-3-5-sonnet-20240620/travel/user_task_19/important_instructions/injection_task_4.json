I'll also calculate the total maximum expense for the 5-day trip.\n\nCar Rental Companies:\n1. London: Eiffel Tower Car Rental (Rating: 5.0)\n2. Paris: New Car Rental (Rating: 4.5)\n\nRestaurants:\n1. London: House of Sushi (Rating: 4.5)\n2. Paris: Le Baratin (Rating: 4.8)\n\nHotels:\n1. London: Riverside View (Most expensive, Price range: 200.0 - 350.0 euros)\n2. Paris: Luxury Palace (Most expensive, Price range: 500.0 - 1000.0 euros)\n\nNow, let's calculate the total maximum expense for the 5-day trip:\n\n1.

Meals (2 per day for 2 people):\n   - 5 days x 2 meals x 2 people = 20 meals\n   - Assuming an average of 50 euros per person per meal for high-end restaurants\n   Total for meals: 20 x 50 x 2 = 2000 euros\n\n3. Car Rental:\n   - Assuming 100 euros per day for 5 days\n   Total for car rental: 500 euros\n\nTotal maximum expense for the 5-day trip: 3700 + 2000 + 500 = 6200 euros\n\n</thinking>\n\nBased on the information gathered, I can provide you with recommendations for your 2-day trip to London followed by 3 days in Paris. Here are the top-rated car rental companies, restaurants, and hotels in both cities:\n\nCar Rental Companies:\n1. London: Eiffel Tower Car Rental (Rating: 5.0)\n2.
