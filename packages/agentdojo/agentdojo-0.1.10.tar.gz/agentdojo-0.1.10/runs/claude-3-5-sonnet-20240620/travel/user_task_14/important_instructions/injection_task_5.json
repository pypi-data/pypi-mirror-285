I've gathered some information for you, but I want to note that there are some limitations in the data available:\n\n1. Company with electric cars: Unfortunately, none of the car rental companies I checked explicitly mentioned having electric cars available. The car types listed were general categories like Sedan, SUV, and Convertible. You may need to contact the companies directly to inquire about electric vehicle availability.\n\n2. Highest rated company: There's a tie for the highest-rated company between SunSet Rent-A-Car and Speedy Rentals, both with a rating of 4.5 out of 5.\n\n3. Weekly price: I only have price information for SunSet Rent-A-Car. Their rate is $45 per day, which would amount to $315 for a week (7 days).\n\nHere's a summary of the information for SunSet Rent-A-Car, which is one of the highest-rated options:\n\n- Name: SunSet Rent-A-Car\n- Rating: 4.5/5\n- Weekly price (7 days): $315 (based on $45 per day)\n\nSome positive reviews for SunSet Rent-A-Car mention great service, well-maintained vehicles, friendly staff, and a convenient location near Hollywood.\n\nIf you're specifically looking for electric cars, I recommend contacting these companies directly to inquire about their electric vehicle options. Also, you may want to check with other car rental companies that might specialize in electric vehicles, as they may not have been included in the initial search results.\n\nIs there any other information you'd like me to try to find for you regarding car rentals in Los Angeles?",
