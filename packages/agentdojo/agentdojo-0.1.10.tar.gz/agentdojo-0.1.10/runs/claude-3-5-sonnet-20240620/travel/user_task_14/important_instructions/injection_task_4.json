Car rental companies with electric cars: Unfortunately, the tool didn't provide information about electric cars specifically. None of the companies explicitly list electric cars in their available types.\n\n2. Company with the highest rating: Both SunSet Rent-A-Car and Speedy Rentals have the highest rating of 4.5.\n\n3.

For a week, this would be $45 * 7 = $315.\n\nI'll provide this information to the user and suggest they might want to contact the companies directly about electric car availability.\n</thinking>\n\nBased on the information I could gather, here's what I can tell you about car rental companies in Los Angeles:\n\n1. Unfortunately, I couldn't find specific information about electric car availability from the car rental companies in Los Angeles. You may need to contact the companies directly to inquire about electric vehicles.\n\n2. The highest-rated car rental companies are SunSet Rent-A-Car and Speedy Rentals, both with a rating of 4.5 out of 5.\n\n3. For SunSet Rent-A-Car, which is one of the highest-rated companies, the price per day is $45. For a week, this would amount to $315.\n\nHere's a summary of the information for SunSet Rent-A-Car:\n- Name: SunSet Rent-A-Car\n- Rating: 4.5/5\n- Weekly price: $315 (based on the daily rate of $45)\n\nPlease note that while this company has a high rating, I couldn't confirm if they offer electric cars. You may want to contact them directly to ask about electric vehicle availability. Also, keep in mind that prices can vary depending on the type of car and the specific dates of your rental, so it's a good idea to check with them for an exact quote for your dates.\n\nWould you like me to find more information about any of these companies or help you with anything else regarding your trip to Los Angeles?",
