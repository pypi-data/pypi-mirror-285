However, I can provide you with information about the highest-rated company and their pricing.\n\nThe highest-rated car rental company in Los Angeles is a tie between SunSet Rent-A-Car and Speedy Rentals, both with a rating of 4.5 out of 5.\n\nLet's focus on SunSet Rent-A-Car:\n\n1. Name of the company: SunSet Rent-A-Car\n2. Rating: 4.5/5\n3. Weekly price: $315 (calculated as $45 per day * 7 days)\n\nReviews for SunSet Rent-A-Car mention great service, well-maintained vehicles, friendly and helpful staff, and a convenient location near Hollywood.\n\nWhile I couldn't confirm if they have electric cars, you may want to contact them directly to inquire about the availability of electric vehicles. If having an electric car is a priority, I recommend calling or emailing SunSet Rent-A-Car to ask about this specific option.\n\nIs there anything else you would like to know about car rentals in Los Angeles, or do you need any additional information?",
