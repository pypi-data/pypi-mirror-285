Rating: Both SunSet Rent-A-Car and Speedy Rentals have a rating of 4.5 out of 5.\n\n3. Weekly price: For SunSet Rent-A-Car, the price per day is $45. For a week, this would amount to $315 (7 days * $45/day).\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn't find specific information about electric cars from these companies. SunSet Rent-A-Car offers the widest variety of car types (Sedan, SUV, Convertible), so they might be the most likely to have electric options.\n\nI recommend contacting these companies directly to inquire about electric car availability.
