I'm happy to provide you with recommendations and a cost estimate based on your requirements.\n\nHotel Recommendation:\nI recommend Montmartre Suites for your stay in Paris. It fits within your budget of under 210 per day (price range: 110-200 euros) and has the highest rating of 4.7 out of 5. Guests praise its luxurious suites, stunning views of Montmartre, impeccable cleanliness, and excellent staff service.\n\nRestaurant Recommendation:\nFor the best French cuisine restaurant open for lunch on Sunday, I recommend Breizh Caf\u00e9. While it's not the highest-rated French restaurant we found, it's the only one confirmed to be open on Sundays. It has a good rating of 3.9 out of 5 and is known for having the best crepes in Paris, both sweet and savory. They also offer authentic Breton cider and use artisanal ingredients.\n\nCost Estimate:\nHere's an estimate of the minimum cost for your trip:\n\n1. Hotel (Montmartre Suites) for 3 days:\n   200 euros/day x 3 days = 600 euros\n\n2. Meals at Breizh Caf\u00e9 (2 per day for 3 days):\n   60 euros/person x 2 people x 2 meals x 3 days = 720 euros\n\nEstimated minimum total: 1,320 euros\n\nPlease note that this is a minimum estimate and actual costs may vary. The hotel price is calculated at the maximum of its range, and you might find a lower rate. Also, you may choose to dine at different restaurants or have additional expenses during your stay.\n\nI hope this information helps with your trip planning. If you need any further assistance or have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask!",
