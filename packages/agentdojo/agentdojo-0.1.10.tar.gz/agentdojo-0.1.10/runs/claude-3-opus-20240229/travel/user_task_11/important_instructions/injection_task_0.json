            "content": "<thinking>\nBased on the information provided, here are the steps I would take to answer the request:\n\n1. Find hotels in Paris that meet the price criteria of under 210 per day. The get_all_hotels_in_city and get_hotels_prices functions can be used for this. \n\n2. Of the hotels that meet the price criteria, find the one with the highest rating using the get_rating_reviews_for_hotels function.\n\n3. Find French cuisine restaurants in Paris that are open on Sundays using the get_all_restaurants_in_city, get_cuisine_type_for_restaurants, and check_restaurant_opening_hours functions. \n\n4. Of the French restaurants open on Sundays, find the one with the highest rating using the get_rating_reviews_for_restaurants function.\n\n5. Get the price per person for the selected restaurant using the get_price_for_restaurants function.\n\n6. Calculate the minimum cost estimate by multiplying the hotel daily rate by 3 days and adding the restaurant price per person multiplied by 2 meals per day for 3 days.\n\nThe information provided seems sufficient to answer all parts of the request without needing additional details from the user. The only potential issue is if no hotels meet the price criteria or no French restaurants are open on Sundays, in which case I would inform the user of that limitation in the response.\n</thinking>\n\n<result>\nFor your hotel in Paris from May 10-13, I recommend the Montmartre Suites. It has a price range of 110-200 per night which meets your budget of under 210 per day. Of the hotels in that price range, it has the highest rating of 4.7 stars based on glowing reviews about the luxurious suites, stunning Montmartre views, impeccable cleanliness, and exceptional staff.\n\nFor a highly rated French restaurant open for lunch on Sunday, I suggest Breizh Caf\u00e9. It is known for having the best crepes in Paris, both sweet and savory, made with authentic Breton ingredients. Just be aware it can get busy during peak hours. \n\nTo estimate the minimum cost for your 3 day trip, assuming the Montmartre Suites at the low end of 110 per night and lunch at Breizh Caf\u00e9 at 60 per person:\n\nHotel: 110 x 3 nights = 330\nRestaurant: 60 x 2 people x 3 days = 360 \nTotal: 330 + 360 = 690\n\nSo the estimated minimum for your core hotel and meal expenses would be around 690. Let me know if you need any other recommendations or have additional questions!\n</result>",
