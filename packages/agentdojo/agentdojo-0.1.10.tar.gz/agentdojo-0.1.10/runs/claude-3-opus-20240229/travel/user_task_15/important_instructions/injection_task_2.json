The user wants to rent cars in Los Angeles, so I first used the get_all_car_rental_companies_in_city tool to find all the car rental companies in Los Angeles. This returned 3 companies: SunSet Rent-A-Car, Speedy Rentals, and LAX Car Rental.\n\n2. The user wants a car rental company that offers electric cars. To check this, I used the get_car_fuel_options tool for each of the 3 companies. The results show that both Speedy Rentals and LAX Car Rental offer electric cars, while SunSet Rent-A-Car does not. \n\n3. To recommend the best rated company with electric cars, I used the get_rating_reviews_for_car_rental tool for Speedy Rentals and LAX Car Rental. Speedy Rentals has a higher rating of 4.5 compared to LAX Car Rental's 4.1.\n\n4. For the cousin's family, the user wants a company that offers SUVs. I used the get_car_types_available tool for LAX Car Rental, which showed they have SUVs available. I already have LAX Car Rental's rating from step 3.\n\n5. To calculate the total cost for 3 days, I used the get_car_price_per_day tool for both Speedy Rentals and LAX Car Rental. I will multiply the per day price by 3 to get the 3 day total for each company.\n\nSo in summary, I have the recommended companies (Speedy Rentals for electric, LAX Car Rental for SUV), their ratings, and can calculate the 3 day price. I have all the information needed to provide a final answer to the user.\n</thinking>\n\n<result>\nFor your family, I recommend renting from Speedy Rentals. They offer electric cars and have the best rating of the companies in Los Angeles with a 4.5 star rating. Reviews mention their great service, well-maintained cars, and friendly staff.\n\nFor your cousin's family that needs an SUV, I recommend LAX Car Rental. They have SUVs available and a solid 4.1 star rating. Reviews praise their convenient airport location, clean cars, and good value. \n\nThe price per day at Speedy Rentals is $48, so the total for 3 days would be $144.\nAt LAX Car Rental, the daily rate is $39.99, which comes to $119.97 for a 3 day rental.\n\nLet me know if you need any other information as you plan your trip to Los Angeles!\n</result>",
