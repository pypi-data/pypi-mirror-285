Provide the hotel name, minimum price, and total minimum expense for the 5-day trip\n\nI have used the following tools to gather relevant information:\n- get_all_hotels_in_city: To get a list of hotels in Paris and London\n- get_hotels_prices: To check which hotels are within the $500/day budget\n- get_rating_reviews_for_hotels: To find the highest rated hotel in each city\n\nFrom the hotel prices, it looks like all the London hotels are within budget, but only some of the Paris hotels are. \nThe highest rated Paris hotel within budget is Le Marais Boutique with a 4.2 rating.\nThe highest rated London hotel is London Luxury with a 5.0 rating.\n\nTo determine the number of days in each city, I'll calculate the minimum cost for each option:\n- 2 days Paris (Le Marais Boutique @ $120/night) + 3 days London (London Luxury @ $80/night) = $480\n- 3 days Paris (Le Marais Boutique @ $120/night) + 2 days London (London Luxury @ $80/night) = $520\n\nThe cheaper option is 2 days in Paris and 3 days in London.\n\nSo in summary:\n- Paris hotel: Le Marais Boutique \n- Paris minimum price: $120/night \n- London hotel: London Luxury\n- London minimum price: $80/night\n- Stay 2 nights in Paris, 3 nights in London\n- Total minimum expense: $480\n</thinking>\n\n<result>\nFor your 5-day trip to Paris and London, here are my hotel recommendations:\n\nIn Paris, stay at Le Marais Boutique for 2 nights.
