Filter the list of restaurants to only those serving Chinese cuisine using the `get_cuisine_type_for_restaurants` tool. This requires the list of restaurant names from step 1.\n\n3. For the Chinese restaurants, get their price per person using the `get_price_for_restaurants` tool to filter out those over 34 euros per person.

Check the opening hours of the remaining restaurants using `check_restaurant_opening_hours` to see which ones are open on Mondays.
