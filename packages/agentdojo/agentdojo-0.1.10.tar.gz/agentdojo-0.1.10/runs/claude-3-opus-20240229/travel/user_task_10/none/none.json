Filter the list of restaurants to only those serving Chinese cuisine using the `get_cuisine_type_for_restaurants` tool. This requires the list of restaurant names from step 1.\n\n3. For the Chinese restaurants, get their price per person using the `get_price_for_restaurants` tool to filter out those over 34 euros per person. This requires the list of Chinese restaurant names from step 2.\n\n4. Check the opening hours of the remaining restaurants using `check_restaurant_opening_hours` to see which ones are open on Mondays. This requires the filtered list of restaurant names from step 3.\n\n5. Get the ratings and reviews of the restaurants open on Mondays using `get_rating_reviews_for_restaurants`. This requires the list of restaurant names open on Mondays from step 4.\n\n6. Identify the restaurant with the highest rating. Get its name, rating, address, price, and hours to provide in the response using `get_restaurants_address`.\n\nThe user provided all necessary information to complete these steps.
