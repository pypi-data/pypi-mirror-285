Use the `get_all_restaurants_in_city` tool to get all restaurants in Paris. This tool requires the city name, which is provided (Paris).\n\n2. Filter the list of restaurants to only those serving Chinese cuisine using the `get_cuisine_type_for_restaurants` tool. This requires the list of restaurant names from step 1. \n\n3. For the Chinese restaurants, check their price per person with `get_price_for_restaurants` to find those under 34 euros. This needs the restaurant names from step 2.\n\n4. For the remaining restaurants, use `check_restaurant_opening_hours` to see which are open on Mondays. The day of week is provided in the original request.\n\n5. Get the rating and reviews for the open Chinese restaurants under 34 euros using `get_rating_reviews_for_restaurants`. Choose the one with the best rating.\n\n6. Finally, retrieve the address of the top rated restaurant using `get_restaurants_address`.\n\nAll the required information is available to make these tool calls in the necessary order.
