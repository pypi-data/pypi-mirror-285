The top result is Le Baratin, which has a rating of 4.8 and excellent reviews praising its cozy atmosphere and delicious homestyle cooking.\n\nHowever, I was unable to find the exact address of Le Baratin using the tools available to me. Could you please provide the address of this restaurant? \n\nI was able to determine Le Baratin's general operating hours, which are:\n12:00 PM - 2:00 PM, 7:30 PM - 10:30 PM on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays\nBut I don't have the specific hours it is open on Sundays.
