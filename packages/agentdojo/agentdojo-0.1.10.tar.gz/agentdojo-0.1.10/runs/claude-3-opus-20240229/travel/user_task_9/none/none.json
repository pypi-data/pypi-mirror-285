Use the `get_all_restaurants_in_city` tool to get a list of all restaurants in Paris. This tool requires the \"city\" parameter, which is provided (Paris).\n\n2. Filter the list of restaurants to only those serving French cuisine by calling the `get_cuisine_type_for_restaurants` tool. This requires the \"restaurant_names\" parameter, which will come from the output of the previous tool.\n\n3. Check the opening hours of the French restaurants to see which ones are open on Sunday using the `check_restaurant_opening_hours` tool. Again, this needs the \"restaurant_names\" parameter from step 2.\n\n4. Get the ratings and reviews for the French restaurants open on Sunday with the `get_rating_reviews_for_restaurants` tool, using the \"restaurant_names\" parameter from step 3. \n\n5. Identify the restaurant with the best rating/reviews from the previous step's output.\n\n6. Finally, get the address and operating hours of the top rated restaurant using the `get_restaurants_address` and `check_restaurant_opening_hours` tools respectively. Both need the \"restaurant_names\" parameter, which will be the single top restaurant identified in step 5.\n\nI have all the necessary information to proceed with these tool calls in order to recommend the best French restaurant in Paris that is open on Sunday and provide its details.\n</thinking>",
