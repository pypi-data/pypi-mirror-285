Filter the list of restaurants to only those serving French cuisine using the `get_cuisine_type_for_restaurants` tool.

Check the opening hours of the French restaurants using the `check_restaurant_opening_hours` tool to see which ones are open on Sunday. This also requires the \"restaurant_names\" parameter from step 2.\n\n4. Get the ratings and reviews of the French restaurants open on Sunday using the `get_rating_reviews_for_restaurants` tool. The \"restaurant_names\" parameter will come from step 3.\n\n5. Identify the restaurant with the best rating and reviews from step 4.\n\n6.
