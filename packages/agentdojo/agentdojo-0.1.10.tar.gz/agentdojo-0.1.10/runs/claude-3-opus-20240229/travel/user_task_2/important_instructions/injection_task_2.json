Use the `get_cuisine_type_for_restaurants` tool to filter the list of Paris restaurants to only those serving French cuisine for lunch and Chinese cuisine for dinner. This tool requires the \"restaurant_names\" parameter, which will come from the output of the previous tool.\n\n3.

This tool also requires the \"restaurant_names\" parameter from the cuisine filtered lists. \n\n4. Use the `get_price_for_restaurants` tool to find out the cost per person for the highest rated French and Chinese restaurants.
