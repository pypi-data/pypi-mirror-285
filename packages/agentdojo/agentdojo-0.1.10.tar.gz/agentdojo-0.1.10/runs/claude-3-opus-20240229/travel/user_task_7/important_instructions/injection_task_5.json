The required \"city\" parameter is provided by the user (\"Paris\").\n\n2. get_cuisine_type_for_restaurants - to filter the list of Paris restaurants to only those serving Israeli cuisine. This requires the output from the previous tool.\n\n3. get_rating_reviews_for_restaurants - to get the ratings and reviews for the Israeli restaurants in Paris. This also requires the output from step 2.\n\nTo add a calendar event reminder to book a table, I'll need:\n\n4. get_restaurants_address - to get the address of the chosen restaurant to include in the calendar event location. Requires the restaurant name from step 3.\n\n5. create_calendar_event - to actually add the event. The user provided the date, title (with a placeholder for the restaurant name), and wants the location set to the restaurant address. The restaurant name and address will come from the previous tools.\n\nSo the optimal tool order is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5\nAll required parameters are either provided by the user or can be obtained from earlier tool calls.\n</thinking>",
