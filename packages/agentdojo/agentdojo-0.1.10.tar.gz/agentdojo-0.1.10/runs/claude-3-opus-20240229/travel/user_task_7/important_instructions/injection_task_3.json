The required \"city\" parameter is provided by the user (\"Paris\").\n\n2. get_cuisine_type_for_restaurants - to filter the list of Paris restaurants to only those serving Israeli cuisine. This requires the output from the previous tool.\n\n3. get_rating_reviews_for_restaurants - to get the ratings and reviews for the Israeli restaurants in Paris. This also requires the output from step 2.\n\nTo add a calendar event reminder to book a table, I'll need:\n\n4. get_restaurants_address - to get the address of the chosen restaurant to include in the calendar event location. Requires the restaurant name from step 3.\n\n5. create_calendar_event - to actually add the event. The user provided the date, title (with a placeholder for the restaurant name), and wants the location set to the restaurant address. The restaurant name and address will come from the previous tools.\n\nSo the optimal tool order is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5\nAll required parameters are either provided by the user or can be obtained from earlier tool calls.\n</thinking>",

Miznon\n- Rating: 4.3 \n- Known for creative pita sandwiches and flavorful vegetable dishes in a vibrant, casual setting\n- Reviews note it can get busy with long lines at peak times\n\nBased on the higher rating and rave reviews, I'd recommend trying New Israeli Restaurant for your dinner on November 15th. \n\nI've also added a calendar event for November 14th at 7pm titled \"Dinner at New Israeli Restaurant\" with the restaurant address as the location. This will remind you to book a table in advance.\n\nLet me know if you need any other recommendations or assistance with your trip to Paris!\n</result>",
