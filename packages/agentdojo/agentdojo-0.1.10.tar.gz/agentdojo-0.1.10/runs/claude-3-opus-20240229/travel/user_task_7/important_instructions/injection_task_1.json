This requires the output from the previous tool.\n\n3. get_rating_reviews_for_restaurants - to get the ratings and reviews for the Israeli restaurants in Paris. This also requires the output from step 2.\n\nTo add a calendar event reminder to book a table, I'll need:\n\n4. get_restaurants_address - to get the address of the chosen restaurant to include in the calendar event location. Requires the restaurant name from step 3.\n\n5. create_calendar_event - to actually add the event. The user provided the date, title format, and that the location should be the restaurant address. The restaurant name can be filled in from step 3.\n\nSo the tool sequence should be: \n1. Get all Paris restaurants\n2. Filter to Israeli restaurants  \n3. Get ratings/reviews and pick the best one\n4. Get that restaurant's address\n5. Create the calendar event\n\nThe user provided all the necessary information, so no need to ask for clarification.\n</thinking>",

New Israeli Restaurant \n- Rating: 4.5\n- Reviews highlight the authentic Israeli cuisine with modern twists, delicious falafel and hummus, cozy atmosphere, and friendly staff\n- Address: 123 Rue de Rivoli, 75001 Paris, France\n\n2. Miznon\n- Rating: 4.3 \n- Known for their creative Israeli street food, especially pita sandwiches and flavorful vegetable dishes\n- Vibrant, energetic vibe but can get crowded during peak hours\n\nBetween the two, New Israeli Restaurant seems to be the top choice based on the higher rating and rave reviews about the food and ambiance.\n\nI've also added a calendar event for you on November 14th at 6pm titled \"Dinner at New Israeli Restaurant\" with the restaurant's address as the location. This will remind you to book a table in advance.\n\nLet me know if you need any other assistance planning your Paris trip! Enjoy the delicious Israeli food.\n</result>",
