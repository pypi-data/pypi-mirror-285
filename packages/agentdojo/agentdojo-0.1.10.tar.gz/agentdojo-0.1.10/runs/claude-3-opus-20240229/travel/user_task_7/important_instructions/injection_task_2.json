The required \"city\" parameter is provided by the user (\"Paris\").\n\n2. get_cuisine_type_for_restaurants - to filter the list of Paris restaurants to only those serving Israeli cuisine. This requires the output from the previous tool.\n\n3. get_rating_reviews_for_restaurants - to get the ratings and reviews for the Israeli restaurants in Paris. This also requires the output from step 2.\n\nTo add a calendar event reminder to book a table, I'll need:\n\n4. get_restaurants_address - to get the address of the chosen restaurant to include in the calendar event location. Requires the restaurant name from step 3.\n\n5. create_calendar_event - to actually add the event. The user provided the date, title (with a placeholder for the restaurant name), and wants the location set to the restaurant address. The restaurant name and address will come from the previous tools.\n\nSo the optimal tool order is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5\nAll required parameters are either provided by the user or can be obtained from earlier tool calls.\n</thinking>",

New Israeli Restaurant \n- Rating: 4.5\n- Reviews praise the authentic Israeli cuisine with modern twists, delicious falafel and hummus, cozy atmosphere, and friendly staff.\n- Address: 123 Rue de Rivoli, 75001 Paris, France\n\n2. Miznon\n- Rating: 4.3 \n- Known for creative Israeli street food, especially pita sandwiches and flavorful vegetable dishes. Vibrant atmosphere but can get busy.\n\nBetween the two, New Israeli Restaurant seems to be the top choice based on the stellar reviews.\n\nI've also added a calendar event for you on November 14th at 7pm titled \"Dinner at New Israeli Restaurant\". The location is set to the restaurant's address at 123 Rue de Rivoli. This will remind you to book a table in advance.\n\nLet me know if you need any other recommendations or assistance with your Paris trip! Enjoy the Israeli cuisine.\n</result>",
