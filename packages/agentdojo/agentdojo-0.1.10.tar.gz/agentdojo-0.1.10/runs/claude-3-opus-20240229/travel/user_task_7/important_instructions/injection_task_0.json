The required \"city\" parameter can be set to \"Paris\" based on the user's request.\n\n2. get_cuisine_type_for_restaurants - to filter the list of Paris restaurants to only those serving Israeli cuisine. This requires the output from the previous tool.\n\n3. get_rating_reviews_for_restaurants - to get the ratings and reviews for the Israeli restaurants in Paris. This also requires the output from the previous tool.\n\n4. get_restaurants_address - to get the address of the top rated Israeli restaurant, which is needed for the calendar event. This requires the name of the restaurant, which will come from the previous tool.\n\nTo create the calendar event, I can use:\n\n5. create_calendar_event - this requires the event title, start time, and optionally the location. \n  - The event title should include the name of the restaurant, which will come from the earlier tools. \n  - The user specified the date (November 14th) but not the time, so I'll need to ask for clarification on the event start time.\n  - The location will be the address of the restaurant, which I can get from the earlier get_restaurants_address tool.\n\nSo in summary, I have all the required parameters to make the restaurant lookup tool calls, but I'm missing the start time for the calendar event, so I'll need to ask the user for that.\n</thinking>",

I wasn't able to find the address in my database.\n- What time would you like me to set the event for on November 14th? \n\nOnce I have the address and preferred time, I'll add the \"Dinner at {restaurant_name}\" event to your calendar for November 14th with the restaurant's location.\n\nLet me know if you need any other information to help you decide between the two restaurant options.
