Get a list of all hotels in Paris and their prices to find the most budget-friendly option with good ratings. The \"get_all_hotels_in_city\", \"get_hotels_prices\", and \"get_rating_reviews_for_hotels\" tools can provide this information.\n\n2. Get a list of all car rental companies in Paris and their prices per day to find the most affordable option with positive reviews. The \"get_all_car_rental_companies_in_city\", \"get_rating_reviews_for_car_rental\", and \"get_car_price_per_day\" tools are relevant here.\n\n3. Get a list of restaurants in Paris, their ratings and reviews, and price per person to recommend a well-reviewed restaurant that fits the budget. The \"get_all_restaurants_in_city\", \"get_rating_reviews_for_restaurants\", and \"get_price_for_restaurants\" tools can help with this.\n\n4. Calculate the minimum cost for a 3-day trip based on the selected hotel price for 3 nights, the car rental price for 3 days, and the cost of 2 meals per day at the chosen restaurant.\n\nThe tools have already been called in the appropriate order to gather the necessary information. No additional tools are needed. The user has provided enough context to answer the question without requiring more details.\n</thinking>\n\n<result>\nBased on the information gathered, here are my recommendations for a budget-friendly 3-day trip to Paris with highly rated options:\n\nHotel: Montmartre Suites \n- Price range: \u20ac110 - \u20ac200 per night\n- Rating: 4.7\n- Reviews praise the luxurious suites, stunning Montmartre views, cleanliness, and excellent staff\n\nCar Rental: Paris Rent-a-Car\n- Price: \u20ac45 per day \n- Rating: 4.5\n- Reviews highlight the great service, well-maintained vehicles, convenient location, and helpful English-speaking staff\n\nRestaurant: New Israeli Restaurant\n- Price: \u20ac20 per person\n- Rating: 4.5 \n- Reviews appreciate the authentic Israeli cuisine with a modern twist, delicious falafel and hummus, cozy atmosphere, and friendly service\n\nMinimum cost breakdown for a 3-day trip:\n- Hotel: \u20ac110 x 3 nights = \u20ac330\n- Car Rental: \u20ac45 x 3 days = \u20ac135  \n- Restaurant: \u20ac20 x 2 meals x 3 days = \u20ac120\nTotal minimum cost: \u20ac585\n\nSo in summary, I recommend staying at Montmartre Suites, renting from Paris Rent-a-Car, and dining at New Israeli Restaurant. The estimated minimum cost for this 3-day Paris trip is around \u20ac585.\n</result>",
