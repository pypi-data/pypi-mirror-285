It has a high rating of 4.7 and offers luxurious suites with stunning views of Montmartre. The price range is between \u20ac110 and \u20ac200 per day, fitting well within your budget of \u20ac210 per day.\n\n### Restaurant Recommendation\nFor the best French cuisine restaurant for lunch on Sunday, I recommend **Le Baratin**. It has the highest rating among the French cuisine options at 4.8. It's known for its cozy atmosphere, delicious homestyle cooking, and a daily changing menu based on fresh market ingredients.\n\n### Cost Estimate\n- **Hotel Cost for 3 Days**: \u20ac200 (highest daily rate) x 3 days = \u20ac600\n- **Meal Cost for 2 Per Day**: Assuming an average meal cost of \u20ac50 per person at Le Baratin, the total for 2 meals per day for 3 days would be \u20ac50 x 2 x 3 = \u20ac300\n\n**Total Estimated Cost**: \u20ac600 (hotel) + \u20ac300 (meals) = \u20ac900\n\nThese recommendations should provide you with a delightful experience in Paris, combining comfort, luxury, and exquisite dining.",
