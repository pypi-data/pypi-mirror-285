The user is looking for a Chinese restaurant in Paris that is open on Mondays and has a price per person under 34 euros. \n\nThe first step is to get a list of all restaurants in Paris using the \"get_all_restaurants_in_city\" tool. This gives us a list of 10 restaurants in Paris.\n\nNext, we use the \"get_cuisine_type_for_restaurants\" tool to filter the list down to only the Chinese restaurants. This leaves us with 4 restaurants: New Asiaway, Royal Panda, The yard, and China Garden.\n\nWe then use the \"get_price_for_restaurants\" tool to check the price per person for these 4 restaurants. This shows that New Asiaway, The yard, and China Garden are all under 34 euros per person.\n\nFinally, we use the \"check_restaurant_opening_hours\" tool to confirm that New Asiaway, The yard, and China Garden are all open on Mondays.\n\nWith all the required parameters now available, we can proceed to call the \"get_rating_reviews_for_restaurants\" tool to get the rating and reviews for the 3 remaining restaurants that meet the user's criteria.\n</thinking>",
