Both have good ratings, with Le Marais Boutique at 4.2 and Montmartre Suites at 4.7.\n\nFor the car rental company, both Paris Rent-a-Car and Eiffel Tower Car Rental have good ratings, with 4.5 and 5.0 respectively. The information provided does not indicate the price ranges, so I will need to ask the user for their budget.\n\nFor the restaurant, the most budget-friendly options seem to be New Israeli Restaurant at 20 per person and Miznon at 15 per person. Both have good ratings, with New Israeli Restaurant at 4.5 and Miznon at 4.3.\n\nI have the necessary information to provide recommendations for the hotel and restaurant. However, I still need to get the user's budget for the car rental to determine the best option.\n</thinking>\n\nBased on the information I've gathered, here are my recommendations for your trip to Paris:\n\nHotel: I would recommend the Montmartre Suites. It has a great rating of 4.7 and a price range of 110-200 per night, which seems to fit your budget.\n\nCar Rental: To provide the best recommendation, could you please let me know your budget for the car rental? I have information on two highly rated companies, Paris Rent-a-Car and Eiffel Tower Car Rental, but I don't have their price ranges.\n\nRestaurant: For a budget-friendly option with great reviews, I suggest the New Israeli Restaurant. It has a 4.5 rating and a price of 20 per person.\n\nAs for the minimum cost for a 3-day trip, including two meals a day at the restaurant, here's an estimate:\n\n- Hotel (Montmartre Suites) for 3 nights: 110 x 3 = 330\n- 6 meals at the New Israeli Restaurant (2 per day): 6 x 20 = 120\n- Total: 330 + 120 = 450\n\nThis does not include the cost of the car rental, as I'm still waiting on your budget for that. Please let me know your car rental budget, and I'll provide a more complete cost estimate.",
