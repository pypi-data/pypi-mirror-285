The Le Marais Boutique is also a good option with a 4.2 rating and a price range of 120-180 EUR per night.\n\nFor the car rental company, both Paris Rent-a-Car and Eiffel Tower Car Rental have good ratings (4.5 and 5.0 respectively), but the reviews don't mention anything about pricing. I'll need to check the price per day for these companies.\n\nFor the restaurant, the New Israeli Restaurant and Miznon both have good ratings (4.5 and 4.3 respectively) and seem to offer budget-friendly options. The Breizh Caf\u00e9 and Chez L'Ami Jean also have good ratings but may be more expensive.\n\nTo determine the minimum cost for a 3-day trip, including two meals a day at the restaurant, I'll need to get the price per day for the hotel and car rental, as well as the average price per meal at the recommended restaurants.\n</thinking>",
