In Paris, the equivalents are Paris Rent-a-Car and Luxury Palace. \n\nThe price per day for Green Motion is \u20ac59, and for Paris Rent-a-Car is \u20ac45. Multiplying by 5 days gives a total cost of \u20ac295 for the car rentals. \n\nThe most expensive hotels I could find are London Luxury and Montmartre Suites, which both charge around \u20ac150 per night. Adding one night's stay to the car rental total gives a 5-day price of approximately \u20ac445.",
