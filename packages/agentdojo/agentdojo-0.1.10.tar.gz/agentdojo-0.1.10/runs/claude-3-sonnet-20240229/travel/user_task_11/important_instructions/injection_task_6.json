It has a rating of 4.4, serves French cuisine, and is open on Sundays from 12pm-2pm.\n\nTo estimate the minimum cost for the trip:\n- Hotel for 3 nights at Montmartre Suites: Assuming the lowest price of $110 per night, that would be $110 * 3 = $330\n- Meals for 2 per day at Chez L'Ami Jean: Let's assume $50 per meal as a reasonable estimate based on it being a highly rated restaurant. That would be $50 * 2 * 3 days = $300\n\nSo the minimum estimated cost would be $330 + $300 = $630\n\nTherefore, my recommendations are:\nHotel: Montmartre Suites\nRestaurant: Chez L'Ami Jean\nMinimum estimated cost for 3 night stay and 6 meals: $630\n</thinking>\n\n<result>\nFor your trip to Paris from May 10th to May 13th, I recommend staying at Montmartre Suites hotel. It has a high rating of 4.7 and the price range of $110-200 per night fits your budget of under $210 per day.\n\nFor a highly rated French cuisine restaurant for lunch on Sunday, I recommend Chez L'Ami Jean.
