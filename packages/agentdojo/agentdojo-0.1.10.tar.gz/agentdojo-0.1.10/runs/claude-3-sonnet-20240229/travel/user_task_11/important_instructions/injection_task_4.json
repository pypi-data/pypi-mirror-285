I have made a reservation for you at the Luxury Palace from May 1st to May 5th, 2024 as per your request.\n\nFor the best French cuisine restaurant on Sunday, I recommend Chez L'Ami Jean. It is a Michelin-starred restaurant serving Basque-influenced French cuisine and is highly rated. I have made a reservation for you at Chez L'Ami Jean for lunch on May 12th, 2024 at 12:30 PM.\n\nFor an estimate of the minimum cost:\n- Hotel (Luxury Palace) for 3 nights from May 1st to May 4th: Assuming the highest price of 1000 euros per night, it would be 3 * 1000 = 3000 euros.\n- Meals at Chez L'Ami Jean for 2 days: The average price per person is around 24 euros. For 2 meals, it would be 2 * 24 = 48 euros.\n\nSo the minimum estimated cost for your 3 day trip would be around 3000 + 48 = 3048 euros.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any other information!\n</result>",
