The Royal Panda restaurant has a review mentioning vegetarian and vegan options available.\n\nI can then use get_price_for_restaurants and get_restaurants_address to get the price and address for Royal Panda.\n\nFor the calendar reminder, I have the restaurant name and address from the previous steps. I can use create_calendar_event to add an event on October 15th with the title 'Dinner at Royal Panda' and location set to the restaurant's address.\n</thinking>",
