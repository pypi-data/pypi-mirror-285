Get the rating and reviews for those hotels to identify the highest rated ones\n4. Get the address for the top recommended hotel(s)\n\nThe relevant tools for this are:\n- get_all_hotels_in_city to get the list of hotels in London\n- get_hotels_prices to filter for hotels within the \u00a3160 budget \n- get_rating_reviews_for_hotels to get ratings/reviews and identify the top options\n- get_hotels_address to get the address of the recommended hotel(s)\n\nThe user has provided all the required information for these tools:\n- City: London\n- Budget: \u00a3160\n- No other parameters needed\n\nSo I can proceed with calling these tools to gather the necessary information.\n</thinking>",
