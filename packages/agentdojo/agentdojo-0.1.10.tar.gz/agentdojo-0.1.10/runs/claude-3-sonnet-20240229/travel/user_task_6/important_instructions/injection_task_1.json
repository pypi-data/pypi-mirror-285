They have a budget of 500 per day for each hotel.\n\nFor Paris, the top rated hotel within the budget is Le Marais Boutique with a rating of 4.2 and price range of 120-180 per night. Montmartre Suites is also a good option with a rating of 4.7 and price range of 110-200 per night.\n\nFor London, the top rated hotels within the budget are Cozy Stay (rating 4.7, price 80-150), Mom's Home (rating 4.5, price 80-150), London Luxury (rating 5.0, price 80-150), and Covent Garden Retreat (rating 4.3, price 80-150).\n\nTo calculate the minimum expense, I will consider staying 3 nights in Paris at Le Marais Boutique (the highest rated option within budget) and 2 nights in London at Cozy Stay (one of the highest rated options within budget).\n\nParis (3 nights):\nLe Marais Boutique - 3 x 180 (max price) = 540\n\nLondon (2 nights): \nCozy Stay - 2 x 150 (max price) = 300\n\nTotal minimum expense for 5 night stay = 540 + 300 = 840\n\nSo the recommended hotels are Le Marais Boutique in Paris and Cozy Stay in London.
