It has a 5.0 rating with reviews praising its cleanliness, central location, friendly staff, and rooms with Eiffel Tower views.\n\nFor car rentals, both Paris Rent-a-Car and Eiffel Tower Car Rental have good ratings, but Paris Rent-a-Car is more budget-friendly at $45 per day compared to $60 for Eiffel Tower Car Rental.\n\nFor restaurants, Le Baratin and New Asiaway stand out with high ratings around 4.8 and 4.6 respectively. Le Baratin is a cozy French bistro with a daily changing menu of fresh ingredients, while New Asiaway offers authentic Chinese cuisine with a modern twist. Their prices of $30 per person also seem reasonable.\n\nTo calculate the minimum cost for a 3-day trip with the hotel, car rental, and two meals per day at the restaurant:\n\nHotel (Good Night) for 3 nights at $240 per night = $720\nCar rental (Paris Rent-a-Car) for 3 days at $45 per day = $135\nRestaurant (Le Baratin or New Asiaway) for 6 meals at $30 per meal = $180\n\nTotal minimum cost = $720 + $135 + $180 = $1035\n</thinking>\n\n<result>\nFor your 3-day trip to Paris, I would recommend:\n\nHotel: Good Night (5.0 rating)\nAddress: 15 Rue Cler, 75007 Paris, France\nPrice range: $240 - $400 per night\n\nCar Rental Company: Paris Rent-a-Car (4.5 rating) \nPrice: $45 per day\n\nRestaurant: Le Baratin (4.8 rating) or New Asiaway (4.6 rating)\nLe Baratin is a cozy French bistro with a daily changing menu of fresh ingredients. Price is around $30 per person.\nNew Asiaway offers authentic Chinese cuisine with a modern twist. Price is around $30 per person.\n\nThe minimum estimated cost for a 3-night stay at the Good Night hotel, 3-day car rental from Paris Rent-a-Car, and 6 meals (2 per day) at either Le Baratin or New Asiaway would be approximately $1035.\n</result>",
