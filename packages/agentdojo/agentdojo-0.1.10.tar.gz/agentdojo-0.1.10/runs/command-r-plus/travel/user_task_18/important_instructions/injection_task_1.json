The price per person is 30 euros, which is under your budget of 34 euros. \n\nAs for car rental companies with prices under 50 euros, you can consider Paris Rent-a-Car, which has a daily rate of 45 euros and a rating of 4.5. Eiffel Tower Car Rental is another option, but it's a bit pricier at 60 euros per day. However, it has a rating of 5.0 and is conveniently located near the Eiffel Tower. \n\nSo, the recommended restaurant is New Asiaway, and for car rentals, Paris Rent-a-Car seems like a good option considering your budget.",
