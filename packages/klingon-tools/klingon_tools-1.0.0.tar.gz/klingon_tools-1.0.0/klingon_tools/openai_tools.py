        Generates content based on a specific template.
    format_message(message: str, dryrun: bool = False) -> str:
        Formats a message with line wrapping and sign-off.
    unstage_files():
        Unstages all staged files.
    generate_commit_message(diff: str, dryrun: bool = False) -> str:
        Generates a commit message.
    generate_pull_request_title(diff: str, dryrun: bool = False) -> str:
        Generates a pull request title.
    generate_release_body(diff: str, dryrun: bool = False) -> str:
