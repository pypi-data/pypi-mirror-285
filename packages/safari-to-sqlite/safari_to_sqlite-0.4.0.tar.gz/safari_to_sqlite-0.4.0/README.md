## How to install

This package is available on PyPI and can be installed with pipx:

```bash
brew install pipx
pipx install safari-to-sqlite
```

## Usage

To save your Safari tabs to a SQLite database, run:

```bash
safari-to-sqlite
```

This will save the tabs to a file called `safari-tabs.db` in your current directory.

Or to specify a database file:

```bash
safari-to-sqlite tabs.db
```

## Authentication
Cross device sync is possible using a [Turso](https://turso.tech) account. 
You can configure your own database or allow this tool to automatically perform setup for you.
To authenticate, run:

```bash
safari-to-sqlite auth
```

If you don't have an existing Turso account or database, no problem!
This command will walk you through the setup process by installing the Turso CLI with brew and creating a new database for you.
Otherwise, you can manually enter your own database URL and token.

## Downloading missing body content

Safari may not return the tab's body content if it is not available for some reason. To download and extract page content when this is missing, run:

```bash
safari-to-sqlite download
```

## Development
