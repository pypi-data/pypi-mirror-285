## ðŸ“Œ Please note:

This package is a minor update to [bingX-connector](https://pypi.org/project/bingX-connector/).
I have opened a pull request as [Ming119](https://github.com/Ming119) instructed in their repoistory. After opening the pull request and mailing them directly and asking them to merge, I got no answer. Therefore, I am publishing this new update with the similar name. This package may be deprecated after they merge.

Keep in mind that for Perpetual v1, no changes were made, so you cannot work demo with that.

  3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; create a [reduced test case](http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/) and a live example.


  Example:

  > Short and descriptive example bug report title
  >
  > A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If
  > suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
  >
  > 1. This is the first step
  > 2. This is the second step
  > 3. Further steps, etc.
  >
  > `<url>` - a link to the reduced test case

-  ### Follow this process if you'd like your work considered for inclusion in the project
  1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork, and configure the remotes:
  
      ```bash
      # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
      git clone https://github.com/<username>/bingX-connector-python.git
      # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
      cd bingX-connector-python
      # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
      git remote add upstream https://github.com/Ming119/bingX-connector-python
      ```

  2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:
  
      ```bash
      git checkout <dev-branch>
      git pull upstream <dev-branch>
      ```
  
  3. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to contain your feature, change, or fix:

      ```bash
      git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
      ```

  4. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

      ```bash
      git pull [--rebase] upstream <dev-branch>
      ```

  5. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

      ```bash
      git push origin <topic-branch-name>
      ```
