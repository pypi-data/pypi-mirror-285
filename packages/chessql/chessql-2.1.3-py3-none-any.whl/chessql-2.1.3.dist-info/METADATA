=================================

.. contents::


Description
===========

This package provides a parser for Chess Query Language ('CQL'_).

The 'documentation'_ for CQL version 6.0.4 as found in first half of 2020 was used as a reference. 

This package does not implement an evaluator to find games in a 'PGN'_ file which match a query.  An evaluator is implemented in `ChessTab`_.


Installation Instructions
=========================

This package is available on PyPI so can be installed by typing

   python -m pip install --user chessql

at the command prompt.

See `Python`_ and `pip`_ documentation for alternatives and platform-specific points.
