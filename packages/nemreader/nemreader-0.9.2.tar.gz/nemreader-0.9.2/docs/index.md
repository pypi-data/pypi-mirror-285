# Welcome to nem-reader documentation!

The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) defines a [Meter Data File Format(MDFF)][mdff]
for reading energy billing data. This library sets out to parse these
NEM12 (interval metering data) and NEM13 (accumulated metering data)
data files into a useful python object, for use in other projects.
