CAS Janitor
===========

Cleanup daemon which is responsible for picking up any mess left by the regular cleaner.

The regular cleaner is required to synchronize between the index and the storage, and
so it is possible to get into a state where the blob is removed from the index but not
removed from the storage (eg. in the event of an error when removing the blob from
storage after removing it's index entry).

The Janitor takes care of this situation by regularly iterating over the entire
storage and removing any blobs which aren't referenced by an index. This ensures that
any hanging blobs are removed in a timely manner and the storage space consumption
doesn't spiral up out of control.
