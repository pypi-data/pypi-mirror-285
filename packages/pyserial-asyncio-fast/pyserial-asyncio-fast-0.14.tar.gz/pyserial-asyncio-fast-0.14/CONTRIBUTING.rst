How Can I Contribute?
=====================

Reporting Bugs and Suggesting Enhancements
    The easiest is creating an issue_. You can do that for ideas or problems.

    For bugs, if possible, try to construct a small code example that exhibits
    the problem. Include version numbers (Python, pySerial,
    pySerial-asyncio).

Pull Requests
    Code / test / documentation contributions are of course welcome_!

    Consider that this is a project that aims to run on many platforms and
    architectures and therefore needs implementations covering all of them, of
    course there are exceptions and starting on one platform is better than
    starting on none.

    When providing new features, also think of documentation and tests if
    possible.
