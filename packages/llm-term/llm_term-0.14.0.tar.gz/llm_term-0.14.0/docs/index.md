## Installation

```bash
pipx install llm-term
```

### Install with Extras

You can install llm-term with extra dependencies for different providers:

```bash
pipx install "llm-term[anthropic]"
```

```bash
pipx install "llm-term[mistralai]"
```

Or, you can install all the extras:

```bash
pipx install "llm-term[all]"
```

## Usage

Then, you can chat with the model directly from the command line:

```shell
llm-term
```

`llm-term` works with multiple LLM providers, but by default it uses OpenAI.
Most providers require extra packages to be installed, so make sure you
read the [Providers](#providers) section below. To use a different provider, you
can set the `--provider` / `-p` flag:

```shell
llm-term --provider anthropic
```

If needed, make sure you have your LLM's API key set as an environment variable
(this can also set via the `--api-key` / `-k` flag in the CLI). If your LLM uses
a particular environment variable for its API key, such as `OPENAI_API_KEY`,
that will be detected automatically.

```shell
export LLM_API_KEY="xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

Optionally, you can set a custom model. llm-term defaults
to `gpt-4o` (this can also set via the `--model` / `-m` flag in the CLI):

```shell
export LLM_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini"
```

Want to start the conversion directly from the command line? No problem,
just pass your prompt to `llm-term`:

```shell
llm-term show me python code to detect a palindrome
```

You can also set a custom system prompt. llm-term defaults to a reasonable
prompt for chatting with the model, but you can set your own prompt (this
can also set via the `--system` / `-s` flag in the CLI):

```shell
export LLM_SYSTEM_MESSAGE="You are a helpful assistant who talks like a pirate."
```

## Providers

### OpenAI

By default, llm-term uses OpenAI as your LLM provider. The default model is
`gpt-4o` and you can also use the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
to set your API key.

### Anthropic

You can request access to Anthropic [here](https://www.anthropic.com/). The
default model is `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620`, and you can use the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment
variable. To use `anthropic` as your provider you must install the `anthropic`
extra.

```shell
pipx install "llm-term[anthropic]"
```

```shell
llm-term --provider anthropic
```

### MistralAI

You can request access to the [MistralAI](https://mistral.ai/)
[here](https://console.mistral.ai/). The default model is
`mistral-small-latest`, and you can use the `MISTRAL_API_KEY` environment variable.

```shell
pipx install "llm-term[mistralai]"
```

```shell
llm-term --provider mistralai
```

### Ollama

Ollama is a an open source LLM provider. These models run locally on your
machine, so you don't need to worry about API keys or rate limits. The default
model is `llama3`, and you can see what models are available on the [Ollama
Website](https://ollama.com/library). Make sure to
[download Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) first.

```shell
ollama pull llama3
```

```shell
llm-term --provider ollama --model llama3
```
