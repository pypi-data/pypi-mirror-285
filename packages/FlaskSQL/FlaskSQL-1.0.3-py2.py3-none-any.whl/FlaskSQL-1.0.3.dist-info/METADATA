FlaskSQL
===========

FlaskSQL is a fork of the [Flask-MySQL](https://github.com/cyberdelia/flask-mysql) project, which appears to no longer be actively maintained. This repository aims to provide ongoing support for Flask applications connecting to MySQL databases.

## Acknowledgments

The initial codebase and much of the foundational work for FlaskSQL are credited to the original creator and contributors of [Flask-MySQL](https://github.com/cyberdelia/flask-mysql). We extend our gratitude for their efforts in developing the initial version.

## Installation

To install FlaskSQL, use pip:
```
    pip3 install FlaskSQL
```

## Usage

Please refer to the existing Flask-MySQL docs until we are able to create new documentation for any future changes.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to help improve FlaskSQL. If you have any feature suggestions or encounter any issues, please open an issue on our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/jzhong00/FlaskSQL/issues) page.
