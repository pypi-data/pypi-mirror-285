"""
This Python script defines a FailureLogger class that logs failed responses from a Language Learning Model (LLM) and the associated job record to disk for later analysis. The script is designed to handle situations where the LLM fails to create a well-formed JSON response. In such cases, the LLM response and the job title are saved to disk in a new folder within the ‘llmFailures’ directory. Each new folder is named with a random 5-digit string for uniqueness. The LLM response is saved as a JSON file, and the job record is saved as a CSV file. The script uses environment variables for secure operations and includes logging for tracking operations and errors. The FailureLogger class is initialized with no arguments, and the logFailedLlmJsonResponse method takes two arguments: the job record and the LLM response.
