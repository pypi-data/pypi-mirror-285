NAME
       dh_quilt_patch - apply patches listed in debian/patches/series

SYNOPSIS
       dh_quilt_patch [debhelper options]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_quilt_patch simply calls quilt push -a after having set the
       environment variable QUILT_PATCHES to debian/patches.  All patches
       listed in debian/patches/series are then applied in the current
       directory. The command does not fail if the patches have already been
       applied.

       You can use another directory instead of debian/patches by setting (and
       exporting) the environment variable QUILT_PATCH_DIR.

EXAMPLES
       dh_quilt_patch is usually called indirectly in a rules file via the dh
       command.

               %:
                       dh $@ --with quilt

       It can also be direcly called at the start of the build (or configure)
       rule.

               build:
                       dh_quilt_patch
                       ./configure
                       $(MAKE)

NOTES
       This tool is useless if you use the source package format 3.0 (quilt).
       Consider switching to this source format if you haven't done it yet.
