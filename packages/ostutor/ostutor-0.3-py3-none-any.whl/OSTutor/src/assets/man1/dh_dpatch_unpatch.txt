NAME
       dh_dpatch_unpatch - unapply patches listed in debian/patched

SYNOPSIS
       dh_dpatch_unpatch [debhelper options]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_dpatch_unpatch simply calls dpatch deapply-all.  All patches listed
       in debian/patched are then unapplied in the current directory. The
       command does not fail if the patches have already been unapplied.

EXAMPLES
       dh_dpatch_unpatch is usually called indirectly in a rules file via the
       dh command.

               %:
                       dh --with dpatch $@

       It can also be direcly called in the clean rule.

               clean:
                       dh_testdir
                       dh_testroot
                       [ ! -f Makefile ] || $(MAKE) clean
                       dh_dpatch_unpatch
                       dh_clean
