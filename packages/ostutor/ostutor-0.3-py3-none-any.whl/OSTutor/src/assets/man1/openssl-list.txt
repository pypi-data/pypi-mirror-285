NAME
       openssl-list, list - list algorithms and features

SYNOPSIS
       openssl list [-help] [-1] [-commands] [-digest-commands]
       [-digest-algorithms] [-cipher-commands] [-cipher-algorithms]
       [-public-key-algorithms] [-public-key-methods] [-disabled]

DESCRIPTION
       This command is used to generate list of algorithms or disabled
       features.

OPTIONS
       -help
           Display a usage message.

       -1  List the commands, digest-commands, or cipher-commands in a single
           column.  If used, this option must be given first.

       -commands
           Display a list of standard commands.

       -digest-commands
           Display a list of message digest commands, which are typically used
           as input to the dgst(1) or speed(1) commands.

       -digest-algorithms
           Display a list of message digest algorithms.  If a line is of the
           form
             foo => bar then foo is an alias for the official algorithm name,
           bar.

       -cipher-commands
           Display a list of cipher commands, which are typically used as
           input to the dgst(1) or speed(1) commands.

       -cipher-algorithms
           Display a list of cipher algorithms.  If a line is of the form
             foo => bar then foo is an alias for the official algorithm name,
           bar.

       -public-key-algorithms
           Display a list of public key algorithms, with each algorithm as a
           block of multiple lines, all but the first are indented.

       -public-key-methods
           Display a list of public key method OIDs: this also includes public
           key methods without an associated ASN.1 method, for example, KDF
           algorithms.

       -disabled
           Display a list of disabled features, those that were compiled out
           of the installation.
