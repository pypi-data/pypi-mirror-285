NAME
       shtool-move - GNU shtool enhanced mv(1) replacement

SYNOPSIS
       shtool move [-v|--verbose] [-t|--trace] [-e|--expand] [-p|--preserve]
       src-file dst-file

DESCRIPTION
       This is a mv(1) style command enhanced with the ability to rename
       multiple files in a single operation and the ability to detect and not
       touch existing equal destinations files, thus preserving timestamps.

OPTIONS
       The following command line options are available.

       -v, --verbose
           Display some processing information.

       -t, --trace
           Enable the output of the essential shell commands which are
           executed.

       -e, --expand
           Expand asterisk in src to be used as ""%"n" (where n is 1,2,...) in
           dst-file. This is useful for renaming multiple files at once.

       -p, --preserve
           Detect src-file and dst-file having equal content and not touch
           existing destination files, thus perserving timestamps. This is
           useful for applications that monitor timestamps, i.e. suppress
           make(1L) repeating actions for unchanged files.

EXAMPLE
        #   shell script

        scanner.c: scanner.l
            lex scanner.l
            shtool move -t -p lex.yy.c scanner.c
