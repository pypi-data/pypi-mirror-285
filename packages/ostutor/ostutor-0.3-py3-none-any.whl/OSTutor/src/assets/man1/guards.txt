NAME
       guards - select from a list of files guarded by conditions

SYNOPSIS
       guards [--prefix=dir] [--path=dir1:dir2:...] [--default=<0|1>]
       [--check|--list] [--invert-match] [--with-guards] [--config=<file>]
       symbol ...

DESCRIPTION
       The script reads a configuration file that may contain so-called
       guards, file names, and comments, and writes those file names that
       satisfy all guards to standard output. The script takes a list of
       symbols as its arguments. Each line in the configuration file is
       processed separately. Lines may start with a number of guards. The
       following guards are defined:

           +xxx Include the file(s) on this line if the symbol xxx is defined.

           -xxx Exclude the file(s) on this line if the symbol xxx is defined.

           +!xxx Include the file(s) on this line if the symbol xxx is not
           defined.

           -!xxx Exclude the file(s) on this line if the symbol xxx is not
           defined.

           - Exclude this file. Used to avoid spurious --check messages.

       The guards are processed left to right. The last guard that matches
       determines if the file is included. If no guard is specified, the
       --default setting determines if the file is included.

       If no configuration file is specified, the script reads from standard
       input.

       The --check option is used to compare the specification file against
       the file system. If files are referenced in the specification that do
       not exist, or if files are not enlisted in the specification file
       warnings are printed. The --path option can be used to specify which
       directory or directories to scan.  Multiple directories are separated
       by a colon (":") character. The --prefix option specifies the location
       of the files. Alternatively, the --path=@<file> syntax can be used to
       specify a file from which the file names will be read.

       Use --list to list all files independent of any rules. Use
       --invert-match to list only the excluded patches. Use --with-guards to
       also include all inclusion and exclusion rules.
