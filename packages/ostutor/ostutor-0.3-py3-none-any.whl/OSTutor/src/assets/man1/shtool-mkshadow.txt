NAME
       shtool-mkshadow - GNU shtool create shadow tree using symlinks

SYNOPSIS
       shtool mkshadow [-v|--verbose] [-t|--trace] [-a|--all] src-dir dst-dir

DESCRIPTION
       This command creates a shadow tree of src-dir under dst-dir by
       recreating the directory hierarchy of src-dir under dst-dir and by
       creating the files of src-dir by linking them into the corresponding
       directories under dst-dir via symbolic links. When src-dir can be
       reached via relative paths from dst-dir, relative symbolic links are
       used, too. This high-level functionality is originally designed for
       developers to create copies of source trees.

OPTIONS
       The following command line options are available.

       -v, --verbose

       -t, --trace

       -a, --all
           Really shadow all files and directories in src-dir. Default is to
           skip CVS related files and directories, backup files, object files,
           etc.
