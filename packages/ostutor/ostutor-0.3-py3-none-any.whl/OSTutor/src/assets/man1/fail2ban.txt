NAME
       fail2ban - a set of server and client programs to limit brute force au-
       thentication attempts.

DESCRIPTION
       Fail2Ban consists of a client, server and configuration files to  limit
       brute force authentication attempts.

       The  server  program  fail2ban-server is responsible for monitoring log
       files and issuing ban/unban commands.  It  gets  configured  through  a
       simple  protocol  by fail2ban-client, which can also read configuration
       files and issue corresponding configuration commands to the server.

       For details on the configuration of fail2ban see the jail.conf(5)  man-
       ual  page.   A jail (as specified in jail.conf) couples filters and ac-
       tions definitions for any given list of files to get monitored.

       For details on the command-line  options  of  fail2ban-server  see  the
       fail2ban-server(1) manual page.

       For  details  on  the command-line options and commands for configuring
       the server via fail2ban-client see the fail2ban-client(1) manual page.

       For testing  regular  expressions  specified  in  a  filter  using  the
       fail2ban-regex  program  may be of use and its manual page is fail2ban-
       regex(1).

LIMITATION
       Fail2Ban is able to reduce the rate of  incorrect  authentications  at-
       tempts  however  it  cannot eliminate the risk that weak authentication
       presents.  Configure services to use only two factor or  public/private
       authentication mechanisms if you really want to protect services.

       A  local  user  is  able  to  inject  messages  into syslog and using a
       Fail2Ban jail that reads from syslog, they can  effectively  trigger  a
       DoS  attack against any IP. Know this risk and configure Fail2Ban/grant
       shell access accordingly.
