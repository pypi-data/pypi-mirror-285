NAME
       cleanlinks - remove dangling symbolic links and empty directories

SYNOPSIS
       cleanlinks

DESCRIPTION
       The  cleanlinks  program searches the directory tree descended from the
       current directory for symbolic links whose targets do  not  exist,  and
       removes  them.  It then removes all empty directories in that directory
       tree.

       cleanlinks is useful for cleaning up a shadow link  tree  created  with
       lndir(1) after files have been removed from the real directory.

DIAGNOSTICS
       A  message  will be printed upon encountering each dangling symlink and
       empty directory.

SEE ALSO
       lndir(1).
