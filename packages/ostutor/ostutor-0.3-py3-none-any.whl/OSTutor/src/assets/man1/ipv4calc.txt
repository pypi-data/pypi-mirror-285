NAME
         ipv4calc - Calculates IPv4 elements from an address.

SYNOPSIS
         ipv4calc [ --network | --broadcast | --netmask |
                    --address | --cidr ] addr

DESCRIPTION
       If an option is specified ipv4calc calculates the requested element
       from the address and prints it on stdout.

       If multiple options are specified, only the first one is printed.

       If no options are specified, the program prints the host part of the
       address, the network and the broadcast address as deduced from the
       given address.

       If address doesn't contains a netmask or mask length, the default one
       is assumed.
