NAME
       estwaver - command line interface of web crawler

SYNOPSIS
       estwaver init [-apn|-acc] [-xs|-xl|-xh] [-sv|-si|-sa] rootdir

       estwaver crawl [-restart|-revisit|-revcont] rootdir

       estwaver unittest rootdir

       estwaver fetch [-proxy hostr port] [-tout num] [-il lang] url

DESCRIPTION
       estwaver  is an aggregation of sub commands.  The name of a sub command
       is specified by the first argument.  Other arguments are parsed accord-
       ing  to  each  sub command.  The argument rootdir specifies the crawler
       root directory which contains configuration file and so on.

       estwaver init [-apn|-acc] [-xs|-xl|-xh] [-sv|-si|-sa] rootdir
              Create the crawler root directory.
              If -apn is specified, N-gram analysis is performed against Euro-
              pean text also.
              If  -acc  is specified, character category analysis is performed
              instead of N-gram analysis.
              If -xs is specified, the index is tuned to  register  less  than
              50000 documents.
              If  -xl  is  specified, the index is tuned to register more than
              300000 documents.
              If -xh is specified, the index is tuned to  register  more  than
              1000000 documents.
              If -sv is specified, scores are stored as void.
              If -si is specified, scores are stored as 32-bit integer.
              If  -sa  is specified, scores are stored as-is and marked not to
              be tuned when search.

       estwaver crawl [-restart|-revisit|-revcont] rootdir
              Start crawling.
              If -restart is specified, crawling is restarted  from  the  seed
              documents.
              If -revisit is specified, collected documents are revisited.
              If  -revcont is specified, collected documents are revisited and
              then crawling is continued.</dd>

       estwaver unittest rootdir
              Perform unit tests.

       estwaver fetch [-proxy hostr port] [-tout num] [-il lang] url
              Fetch a document.
              url specifies the URL of a document.
              -proxy specifies the host name and the port number of the  proxy
              server.
              -tout specifies timeout in seconds.
              -il  specifies  the  preferred language.  By default, it is Eng-
              lish.

       All sub commands return 0 if the operation is success, else  return  1.
       A  running  crawler  finishes with closing the database when it catches
       the signal 1 (SIGHUP), 2 (SIGINT), 3 (SIGQUIT), or 15 (SIGTERM).

       When crawling finishes, there is a directory _index in the crawler root
       directory.  It is an index available by estcmd and so on.
