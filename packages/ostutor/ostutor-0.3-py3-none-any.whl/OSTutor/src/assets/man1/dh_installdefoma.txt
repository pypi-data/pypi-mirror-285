NAME
       dh_installdefoma - install a defoma related scripts

SYNOPSIS
       dh_installdefoma [debhelper options] [-n]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_installdefoma  is  a  debhelper  program that is responsible for in-
       stalling files related to defoma (DEbian  FOnt  MAnager)  into  package
       build  directories.  dh_installdefoma can be used by defoma-aware pack-
       ages and/or font packages using defoma.

       It also automatically generates the postinst  and  pre/postrm  commands
       needed  to register a package as a defoma-aware and/or font package us-
       ing defoma. See dh_installdeb(1) for an explanation of how this works.

       If a file named debian/package.defoma exists, then it is installed into
       usr/share/defoma/scripts/package.defoma  in the package build directory
       and put an un/registration method in maintainer  scripts  with  defoma-
       app.   If  a  file named debian/package.defoma-hints exists, then it is
       installed in etc/defoma/hints/package.hints in the package build direc-
       tory  and  put an un/registration method in maintainer scripts with de-
       foma-font.  So when you create a defoma font package, what you need  to
       do is only to put its hints file in debian/package.defoma-hints and in-
       stall font files written in the hints file  in  the  appropriate  loca-
       tions.  When  you create a defoma-aware package, what you need to do is
       only to put its defoma-script file in debian/package.defoma. The script
       file is automatically installed in the package build directory.
