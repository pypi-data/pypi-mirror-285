NAME
       WebQuiz: a LaTeX package for writing online quizzes -

       WebQuiz  makes  it  possible  to  use LaTeX to write interactive online
       quizzes.  The quizzes are first written in  LaTeX  and  then  converted
       into  HTML  using  WebQuiz,  which is written in python. The conversion
       from LaTeX to HTML is done behind the scenes using TeX4ht. The idea  is
       that  you  should  be able to produce nice online quizzes using WebQuiz
       and basic knowledge of LaTeX.

       WebQuiz is designed to be used from the command-line.  For example,  if
       quiz1.tex is a LaTeX file for a quiz then:

       latex quiz1
              produces a "readable" DVI file for the quiz

       pdflatex quiz1
              produces a "readable" PDF file for the quiz

       webquiz quiz1
              creates the web page quiz1.html

       If  you prefer to use LaTeX from a GUI for LaTeX then it should be pos-
       sible to configure it to use WebQuiz directly. As an example, the  man-
       ual provides some details about how to do this for TeXShop.

INSTALLATION
       To  use  WebQuiz  you  need  to  have a standard LaTeX distribution in-
       stalled, such as TeXLive, that includes TeX4ht. In addition,  you  need
       to  have  Python3  installed.  As WebQuiz uses scalable vector graphics
       (SVG) you should check that all of the dependencies of dvisvgm are  in-
       stalled on your system, especially if you plan on using graphics or im-
       ages.

       Once the TeX components of WebQuiz package have been installed you  can
       install  the  web  components  of  WebQuiz using the following command,
       which needs to be run  from the command line:

       > webquiz --initialise

       If you want to install the web components of WebQuiz into a system  di-
       rectory  then  you  need to run this command from an administrators ac-
       count, so using sudo on a unix-like system. For more details about  the
       installation and configuration of WebQuiz please see Section 3.2 of the
       WebQuiz manual.

       Please see the manual for more details  about  initialising  and  using
       WebQuiz.

INSTALLATION FROM THE CTAN ZIPFILE
       On  both unix-like systems (including macosx), and windows systems (us-
       ing either TeXLive or MiKTeX), you can install WebQuiz  by  downloading
       the WebQuiz zip file from:
          http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/webquiz.zip

       To install the package, unzip this file and change directory to the we-
       bquiz/scripts subdirectory run:

       > webquiz --tex-install

       (or webquiz.bat --text-install on windows). This commands  unpacks  the
       webquiz  files into their standard locations in the TeX install tree to
       it should be run from an administrators account, or  using  sudo  on  a
       unix-like system.  Roughly what this command does is the following:

       o It  creates  a symbolic link, or equivalent, to the main WebQuiz exe-
         cutable, which is the file webquiz.py in the scripts directory

       o Copies the latex directory to somewhere in the TeX  search  path  and
         then runs mktexlsr so that LaTeX and WebQuiz can find these files.

       o Copies the python code into the TeX scripts subdirectory

       o Copies  the WebQuiz doc subdirectory into the TeX doc/latex subdirec-
         tory.

       If you are using MiKTeX you may need to open the MiKTeX console, go  to
       the Tasks menu and then rebuild the TeX filename database.

       Once  the  files above are in place initialise WebQuiz by following the
       installation instructions above.

       Mainly for development purposes, there  is  another  undocumented  com-
       mand-line option for removing these files from TEXMFMAIN:

       > sudo webquiz/scripts/webquiz --tex-uninstall

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
       In  order  to work WebQuiz needs the following programs to be installed
       on your system:

       o An up-to-date LaTeX distribution, such as that provided  by  TeXLive.
         In particular, you need to have TeX4ht and make4ht installed.  Unfor-
         tunately, since TeXLive 2018 was released there have been a  signifi-
         cat bunber of updates to a number of packahges that WebQuiz uses, in-
         cluding updates to TeX4ht, make4ht, tikz and pstricks. For this  rea-
         son,  it is strongly recommended that you all packages from ctan_ be-
         fore using WebQuiz_.

       o python3 As of writing python 3.7.2 is available.

       o Javascript

       o If you plan to use pstricks with WebQuiz, or if you want  to  compile
         the  online  manual  for  WebQuiz,  then  you  need  to  ensure  that
         ghostscript and dvisvgm are installed and properly configured on your
         system. See the WebQuiz manual and the dvisvgm documentation for more
         details

       o A web server. To view online quizzes you of course need a web server.
         As  described  in the Installation section you will also need to copy
         of the WebQuiz components onto your web server using the command:

         > webquiz --initialise

AUTHORS
       The LaTeX component of WebQuiz was written by  Andrew  Mathas  and  the
       python,  css  and javascript code was written by Andrew Mathas (and Don
       Taylor), based on an initial protype of Don Taylor's from  2001.  Since
       2004  the  program  has been maintained and developed by Andrew Mathas.
       Although the program has changed substantially since 2004 Don's idea of
       using TeX4ht, and some of his code, is still very much in use.
