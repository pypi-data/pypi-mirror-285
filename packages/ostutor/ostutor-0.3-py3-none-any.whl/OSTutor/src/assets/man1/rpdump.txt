NAME
       rpdump - alpine remote data utility

SYNTAX
       rpdump [ -f ] -l Local_file -r Remote_folder

DESCRIPTION
       Rpdump  may be used to copy the actual data from remote Alpine configu-
       ration files or address books into a local file.  It is intended to  be
       used  by  system administrators.  Regular users should normally use the
       facilities provided within Alpine.

       Local_file will normally be a local temporary file.   Remote_folder  is
       the  IMAP  folder being used as a remote Alpine configuration (with the
       help of Alpine's -P, -p, and -x commands or PINECONF, PINERC, and  PIN-
       ERCEX  environment  variables) or remote Alpine address book folder.  A
       copy of the data from Remote_folder will be copied to Local_file.

       -f                  Force the dump even if the remote folder is  in  an
                           unrecognized format.

       -l Local_file       The file on this system that is to be copied to.

       -r Remote_folder    A  remote  folder  name to be copied from.  See the
                           Alpine documentation for the  syntax  of  a  remote
                           folder name.  One example is
                           {my.imap.server}remote_pinerc.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Exit status is zero if all goes well, -1 otherwise.
