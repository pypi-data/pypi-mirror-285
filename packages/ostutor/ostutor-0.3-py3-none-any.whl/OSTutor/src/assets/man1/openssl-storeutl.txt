NAME
       openssl-storeutl, storeutl - STORE utility

SYNOPSIS
       openssl storeutl [-help] [-out file] [-noout] [-passin arg] [-text arg]
       [-engine id] [-r] [-certs] [-keys] [-crls] [-subject arg] [-issuer arg]
       [-serial arg] [-alias arg] [-fingerprint arg] [-digest] uri ...

DESCRIPTION
       The storeutl command can be used to display the contents (after
       decryption as the case may be) fetched from the given URIs.

OPTIONS
       -help
           Print out a usage message.

       -out filename
           specifies the output filename to write to or standard output by
           default.

       -noout
           this option prevents output of the PEM data.

       -passin arg
           the key password source. For more information about the format of
           arg see the PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS section in openssl(1).

       -text
           Prints out the objects in text form, similarly to the -text output
           from openssl x509, openssl pkey, etc.

       -engine id
           specifying an engine (by its unique id string) will cause storeutl
           to attempt to obtain a functional reference to the specified
           engine, thus initialising it if needed.  The engine will then be
           set as the default for all available algorithms.

       -r  Fetch objects recursively when possible.

       -certs
       -keys
       -crls
           Only select the certificates, keys or CRLs from the given URI.
           However, if this URI would return a set of names (URIs), those are
           always returned.

       -subject arg
           Search for an object having the subject name arg.  The arg must be
           formatted as /type0=value0/type1=value1/type2=....  Keyword
           characters may be escaped by \ (backslash), and whitespace is
           retained.  Empty values are permitted but are ignored for the
           search.  That is, a search with an empty value will have the same
           effect as not specifying the type at all.

       -issuer arg
       -serial arg
           Search for an object having the given issuer name and serial
           number.  These two options must be used together.  The issuer arg
           must be formatted as /type0=value0/type1=value1/type2=...,
           characters may be escaped by \ (backslash), no spaces are skipped.
           The serial arg may be specified as a decimal value or a hex value
           if preceded by 0x.

       -alias arg
           Search for an object having the given alias.

       -fingerprint arg
           Search for an object having the given fingerprint.

       -digest
           The digest that was used to compute the fingerprint given with
           -fingerprint.
