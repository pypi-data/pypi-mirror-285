DESCRIPTION
       doveadm fetch can be used to fetch  messages'  contents  and  metadata.
       This  can be useful for scripts and for debugging. If you want to fetch
       messages one at a time, see doveadm-search(1).

       Important:
              Please respect your users' privacy.

OPTIONS
       Global doveadm(1) options:

       -D     Enables verbosity and debug messages.

       -f formatter
              Specifies the formatter for formatting  the  output.   Supported
              formatters are:

              flow   prints each line with key=value pairs.

              pager  prints each key: value pair on its own line and separates
                     records with form feed character (^L).

              tab    prints a table header followed  by  tab  separated  value
                     lines.

              table  prints a table header followed by adjusted value lines.

       -o setting=value
              Overrides  the  configuration  setting  from  /etc/dovecot/dove-
              cot.conf and from the userdb with the given value.  In order  to
              override  multiple settings, the -o option may be specified mul-
              tiple times.

       -v     Enables verbosity, including progress counter.

       This command uses by default the output formatter pager.

       Command specific options:

       -A     If the -A option is present, the command will be  performed  for
              all  users.   Using this option in combination with system users
              from userdb { driver = passwd } is not recommended,  because  it
              contains  also  users  with  a lower UID than the one configured
              with the first_valid_uid setting.

              When the SQL userdb module is used  make  sure  that  the  iter-
              ate_query  setting  in /etc/dovecot/dovecot-sql.conf.ext matches
              your database layout.  When using the LDAP userdb  module,  make
              sure  that  the  iterate_attrs  and  iterate_filter  settings in
              /etc/dovecot/dovecot-ldap.conf.ext match your LDAP schema.  Oth-
              erwise doveadm(1) will be unable to iterate over all users.

       -F file
              Execute the command for all the users in the file.  This is sim-
              ilar to the -A option, but instead of getting the list of  users
              from  the  userdb,  they are read from the given file.  The file
              contains one username per line.

       -S socket_path
              The option's argument is either an absolute path to a local UNIX
              domain  socket, or a hostname and port (hostname:port), in order
              to connect a remote host via a TCP socket.

              This allows an administrator to execute doveadm(1) mail commands
              through the given socket.

       -u user/mask
              Run  the command only for the given user.  It's also possible to
              use '*' and '?' wildcards (e.g. -u *@example.org).
              When neither the -A option, nor  the  -F file  option,  nor  the
              -u user was specified, the command will be executed with the en-
              vironment of the currently logged in user.

ARGUMENTS

EXAMPLE
       This example based on the first example from doveadm-search(1).  We are
       fetching  the fields mailbox and date.sent from user bob's mailbox with
       the guid "3a94c928d66ebe4bda04000015811c6a" for the messages  with  the
       UIDs 8, 25 and 45.

       doveadm fetch -u bob "mailbox date.sent" \
       mailbox-guid 3a94c928d66ebe4bda04000015811c6a uid 8,25,45
       mailbox: dovecot/pigeonhole/2.0
       date.sent: 2010-01-19 01:17:41 (+0100)
       ^L
       mailbox: dovecot/pigeonhole/2.0
       date.sent: 2010-01-28 09:38:49 (+0100)
