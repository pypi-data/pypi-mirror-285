NAME
       doveadm-fs - Interact with the abstract mail storage filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       doveadm [-Dv] [-f formatter] fs command [ARGUMENTS]

DESCRIPTION
       The  doveadm fs commands are used to abstractly interact with the stor-
       age backend defined in the Dovecot configuration. It allows  access  to
       the  mailbox structure without needing to know details of how the stor-
       age backend is architected.

OPTIONS
       Global doveadm(1) options:

       -D     Enables verbosity and debug messages.

       -f formatter
              Specifies the formatter for formatting  the  output.   Supported
              formatters are:

              flow   prints each line with key=value pairs.

              pager  prints each key: value pair on its own line and separates
                     records with form feed character (^L).

              tab    prints a table header followed  by  tab  separated  value
                     lines.

              table  prints a table header followed by adjusted value lines.

       -o setting=value
              Overrides  the  configuration  setting  from  /etc/dovecot/dove-
              cot.conf and from the userdb with the given value.  In order  to
              override  multiple settings, the -o option may be specified mul-
              tiple times.

       -v     Enables verbosity, including progress counter.

       This command uses by default the table output formatter.
