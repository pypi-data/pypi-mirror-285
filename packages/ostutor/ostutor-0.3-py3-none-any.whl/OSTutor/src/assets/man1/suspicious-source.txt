NAME
       suspicious-source - search for files that do not meet the GPL's defini-
       tion of "source" for a work

SYNOPSIS
       suspicious-source [options]

DESCRIPTION
       suspicious-source outputs a list of files which are  probably  not  the
       source form of a work.  This should be run in the root of a source tree
       to find files which might not be, in the definition from the  GNU  GPL,
       the "preferred form of the work for making modifications to it".

       The  files  inside  version  control  system directories (like .bzr/ or
       CVS/) are not considered.

       -d directory, --directory=directory
              Check the files in the specified directory instead of  the  cur-
              rent directory.

              Add mimetype to list of white-listed MIME types.
