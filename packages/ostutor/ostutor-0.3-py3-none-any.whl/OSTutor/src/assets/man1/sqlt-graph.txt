DESCRIPTION
       This script will create a graph of your schema.  Only the database
       driver argument (for SQL::Translator) is required.  If no output file
       name is given, then image will be printed to STDOUT, so you should
       redirect the output into a file.

       The default action is to assume the presence of foreign key
       relationships defined via "REFERNCES" or "FOREIGN KEY" constraints on
       the tables.  If you are parsing the schema of a file that does not have
       these, you will find the natural join options helpful.  With natural
       joins, like-named fields will be considered foreign keys.  This can
       prove too permissive, however, as you probably don't want a field
       called "name" to be considered a foreign key, so you could include it
       in the "skip" option, and all fields called "name" will be excluded
       from natural joins.  A more efficient method, however, might be to
       simply deduce the foreign keys from primary keys to other fields named
       the same in other tables.  Use the "natural-join-pk" option to achieve
       this.

       If the schema defines foreign keys, then the graph produced will be
       directed showing the direction of the relationship.  If the foreign
       keys are intuited via natural joins, the graph will be undirected.

       Clustering of tables allows you to group and box tables according to
       function or domain or whatever criteria you choose.  The syntax for
       clustering tables is:

         cluster1=table1,table2;cluster2=table3,table4
