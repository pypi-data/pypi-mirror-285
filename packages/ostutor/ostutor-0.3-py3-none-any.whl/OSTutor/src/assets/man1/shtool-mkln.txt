NAME
       shtool-mkln - GNU shtool enhanced ln(1) replacement

SYNOPSIS
       shtool mkln [-t|--trace] [-f|--force] [-s|--symbolic] src-path [src-
       path ...]  dst-path

DESCRIPTION
       This is a ln(1) style command. It is enhanced to provide automatic
       calculation and usage of relative links with the shortest possible
       path, if possible. Usually if src-path and dst-path are not absolute
       paths or at least they share a common prefix except the root directory
       (``"/"''). When more than one src-path is specified, all of them are
       linked into dst-path.

OPTIONS
       The following command line options are available.

       -t, --trace
           Enable the output of the essential shell commands which are
           executed.

       -f, --force
           Force the creation of the link even if it exists. Default is to
           fail with error.

       -s, --symbolic
           Create a symbolic link instead of a hard-link.

EXAMPLE
        #   shell script
