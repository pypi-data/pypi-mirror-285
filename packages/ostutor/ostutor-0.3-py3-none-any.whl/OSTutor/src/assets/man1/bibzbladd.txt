NAME
       bibzbladd.pl - add Zbl numbers to papers in a given bib file

SYNOPSIS
       bibzbladd  [-d] [-f] [-e 1|0] [-o output] bib_file

OPTIONS
       -d  Debug mode

       -e  If 1 (default), add an empty zblnumber if a zbl cannot be found.
           This prevents repeated searches for the same entries if you add new
           entries to the file.  Calling "-e 0" suppresses this behavior.

       -f  Force searching for Zbl numbers even if the entry already has one.

       -o output
           Output file.  If this option is not used, the name for the output
           file is formed by adding "_zbl" to the input file

DESCRIPTION
       The script reads a BibTeX file.  It checks whether the entries have
       Zbls.  If not, tries to contact internet to get the numbers.  The
       result is a BibTeX file with the fields "zblnumber=..." added.

       The name of the output file is either set by the -o option or is
       derived by adding the suffix "_zbl" to the output file.
