NAME
       mymeta-cpanfile - Dump cpanfile out of (MY)META files

SYNOPSIS
         perl Makefile.PL # or Build.PL
         mymeta-cpanfile

         # Skip configures phase and suggests type
         mymeta-cpanfile --no-configure --no-suggests

         # Include empty blcok for phases without prereqs
         mymeta-cpanfile --include-empty

DESCRIPTION
       This script reads prereqs metadata from MYMETA files in the current
       directory and prints "cpanfile" that represents the prereqs. Useful
       when you want to migrate to using cpanfile from existing "Makefile.PL"
       or "Build.PL" with dependency specification.

       This script is distributed with Module::CPANfile since version 0.9021.

OPTIONS
       --configure, --build, --test, --runtime, --develop
           Specify the phase to include/exclude. Defaults to include all
           phases, but you can exclude some phases by specifying the options
           with "--no-" prefix, like "--no-configure".

       --requires, --recommends, --suggests, --conflicts
           Specify the type to include/exclude. Defaults to include all types,
           but you can exclude some types by specifying the options with
           "--no-" prefix, like "--no-conflicts".

       --include-empty
           By default, phases without any prereqs are not dumped, By giving
           this option, cpanfile will have an empty block such as:

             on test => sub {

             };

           Defaults to false.
