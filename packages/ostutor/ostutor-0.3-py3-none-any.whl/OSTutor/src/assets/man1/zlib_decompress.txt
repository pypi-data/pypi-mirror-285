
ZLIB_DECOMPRESS(1)           MySQL Database System          ZLIB_DECOMPRESS(1)

NAME
       zlib_decompress - decompress mysqlpump ZLIB-compressed output

SYNOPSIS
       zlib_decompress input_file output_file

DESCRIPTION
       The zlib_decompress utility decompresses mysqlpump output that was
       created using ZLIB compression.

           Note
           zlib_decompress is deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.34; expect it to be
           removed in a future version of MySQL. This is because the
           associated mysqlpump utility is deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.34.

           Note
           If MySQL was configured with the -DWITH_ZLIB=system option,
           zlib_decompress is not built. In this case, the system openssl zlib
           command can be used instead.

       Invoke zlib_decompress like this:

           zlib_decompress input_file output_file

       Example:

           mysqlpump --compress-output=ZLIB > dump.zlib
           zlib_decompress dump.zlib dump.txt

       To see a help message, invoke zlib_decompress with no arguments.

       To decompress mysqlpump LZ4-compressed output, use lz4_decompress. See
       lz4_decompress(1).
