NAME
       rbash - restricted bash, see bash(1)

RESTRICTED SHELL
       If bash is started with the name rbash, or the -r option is supplied at
       invocation, the shell becomes restricted.  A restricted shell  is  used
       to  set  up an environment more controlled than the standard shell.  It
       behaves identically to bash with the exception that the  following  are
       disallowed or not performed:

       o      changing directories with cd

       o      setting or unsetting the values of SHELL, PATH, ENV, or BASH_ENV

       o      specifying command names containing /

       o      specifying  a  filename  containing  a / as an argument to the .
              builtin command

       o      specifying a filename containing a slash as an argument  to  the
              -p option to the hash builtin command

       o      importing  function  definitions  from  the shell environment at
              startup

       o      parsing the value of SHELLOPTS from  the  shell  environment  at
              startup

       o      redirecting output using the >, >|, <>, >&, &>, and >> redirect-
              ion operators

       o      using the exec builtin command to replace the shell with another
              command

       o      adding  or  deleting builtin commands with the -f and -d options
              to the enable builtin command

       o      using the  enable  builtin  command  to  enable  disabled  shell
              builtins

       o      specifying the -p option to the command builtin command

       o      turning off restricted mode with set +r or set +o restricted.

       These restrictions are enforced after any startup files are read.

       When  a  command  that is found to be a shell script is executed, rbash
       turns off any restrictions in the shell spawned to execute the script.
