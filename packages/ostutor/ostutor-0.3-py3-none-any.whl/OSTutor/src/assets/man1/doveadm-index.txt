NAME
       doveadm-index - Index mailboxes

SYNOPSIS
       doveadm [-Dv] index [-S socket_path] [-q] [-n max_recent] mailbox
       doveadm [-Dv] index [-S socket_path] -A [-q] [-n max_recent] mailbox
       doveadm [-Dv] index [-S socket_path] -F file [-q] [-n max_recent] mail-
       box
       doveadm [-Dv] index [-S socket_path] -u user [-q] [-n max_recent] mail-
       box

DESCRIPTION
       Add unindexed messages in a mailbox into index/cache file. If full text
       search is enabled, also add unindexed messages to the fts database.

       The caching adds only the fields that  were  previously  added  to  the
       mailbox's  caching  decisions, so it won't do anything useful for mail-
       boxes that user's client hasn't accessed yet. You can use doveadm  dump
       command to show a specific mailbox's current caching decisions.

       Messages  can also be added automatically to full text search index us-
       ing:

       plugin {
         ...
         fts_autoindex = yes
       }
       in /etc/dovecot/conf.d/90-plugin.conf.

OPTIONS
       Global doveadm(1) options:

       -D     Enables verbosity and debug messages.

       -o setting=value
              Overrides  the  configuration  setting  from  /etc/dovecot/dove-
              cot.conf  and from the userdb with the given value.  In order to
              override multiple settings, the -o option may be specified  mul-
              tiple times.

       -v     Enables verbosity, including progress counter.

       Command specific options:

       -A     If  the  -A option is present, the command will be performed for
              all users.  Using this option in combination with  system  users
              from  userdb  { driver = passwd } is not recommended, because it
              contains also users with a lower UID  than  the  one  configured
              with the first_valid_uid setting.

              When  the  SQL  userdb  module  is used make sure that the iter-
              ate_query setting in  /etc/dovecot/dovecot-sql.conf.ext  matches
              your  database  layout.  When using the LDAP userdb module, make
              sure that  the  iterate_attrs  and  iterate_filter  settings  in
              /etc/dovecot/dovecot-ldap.conf.ext match your LDAP schema.  Oth-
              erwise doveadm(1) will be unable to iterate over all users.

       -F file
              Execute the command for all the users in the file.  This is sim-
              ilar  to the -A option, but instead of getting the list of users
              from the userdb, they are read from the given  file.   The  file
              contains one username per line.

       -n max_recent
              An  integer value, which specifies the maximum number of \Recent
              messages in  mailboxes.   If  the  mailbox  contains  more  than
              max_recent  messages with \Recent flag set, the mailbox will not
              be indexed.  This may be useful to  avoid  unnecessary  indexing
              for large mailboxes that are never opened.

       -q     Queues  the  indexing  to be run by indexer process.  Without -q
              the indexing is done directly by the doveadm(1)  process.   Some
              backends  like fts-lucene can't handle multiple processes updat-
              ing the indexes simultaneously, so -q should usually be used  on
              production.

       -S socket_path
              The option's argument is either an absolute path to a local UNIX
              domain socket, or a hostname and port (hostname:port), in  order
              to connect a remote host via a TCP socket.

              This allows an administrator to execute doveadm(1) mail commands
              through the given socket.

       -u user/mask
              Run the command only for the given user.  It's also possible  to
              use '*' and '?' wildcards (e.g. -u *@example.org).
              When  neither  the  -A  option,  nor the -F file option, nor the
              -u user was specified, the command will be executed with the en-
              vironment of the currently logged in user.

ARGUMENTS
       mailbox
              The name of the mailbox to index.

EXAMPLE
       Index bob's INBOX:

       doveadm index -u bob INBOX
