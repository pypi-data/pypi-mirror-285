NAME
       pdfjam - A shell script for manipulating PDF files

SYNOPSIS
       pdfjam [OPTION [OPTION] ...] [SRC [PAGESPEC] [SRC [PAGESPEC]] ...]

DESCRIPTION
       pdfjam  provides  a  front  end  to most capabilities of the "pdfpages"
       package (by Andreas Matthias) of pdflatex.  Detailed information can be
       found via "pdfjam --help", and also in the web page mentioned below .

       A  working  installation of pdflatex, with the pdfpages package, is re-
       quired.

       The pdfjam script is distributed as (the main) part of the pdfjam pack-
       age.  The homepage of pdfjam is at https://github.com/DavidFirth/pdfjam
       .

SETUP
       See https://github.com/DavidFirth/pdfjam

CONFIGURATION FILES
       Configuration of the PDFjam utilities involves specifying the  location
       of  pdflatex, the location of temporary files, specification of default
       page size, etc.  This is done in a block of lines near the top  of  the
       pdfjam  script;  settings  made  there  are over-ridden by any that are
       found  at  a  site-wide  configuration   file   (at   /etc/pdfjam.conf,
       /usr/share/etc/pdfjam.conf,  /usr/local/share/pdfjam.conf,  or /usr/lo-
       cal/etc/pdfjam.conf), which in turn are over-ridden  by  any  that  are
       found in a user-defaults file at ~/.pdfjam.conf.

LIMITATIONS AND BUGS
       pdfjam  does  not  work with encrypted PDF files, and does not preserve
       hyperlinks.
