NAME
       munindoc - Munin documentation

DESCRIPTION
       This program displays Munin documentation, esp. plugin documentation.
       Note that not all plugins are documented yet.

       Most Munin commands (such as munin-run, and munindoc itself) is only
       documented through the usual Unix man command.

PLUGIN DOCUMENTATION
       The plugin documentation should include basic usage information,
       anything you want to know about configuration, and how to interpret the
       output.

       Additional information typically found is usually the name of the
       plugin author, licensing and "magic markers" which controls plugin auto
       configuration (done by munin-node-configure).

       If you want to document a plugin you can take a look at
       http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/munindoc for details on how to do it.
