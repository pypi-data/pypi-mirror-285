NAME
       imgsize - read the dimensions of an image in several popular formats

USAGE
        imgsize [ -r | -a | -f fmt ] file [ file ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       No-brainer to size an image supplied on the command-line. All the real
       work is done in Image::Size.

REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
       imgsize expects file names on the command-line. If more than one file
       is provided, the file name will be included in the output:

           % imgsize dot.gif
           width="16" height="16"
           % imgsize dot.gif dash.gif
           dot.gif: width="16" height="16"
           dash.gif: width="32" height="8"

OPTIONS
       By default, the width and height are returned as attributes for an IMG
       tag in HTML, essentially "width="40" height="30"" or similar. The
       following options may be used to return alternate formats (all report
       width first, then height):

       "-r"
           Return "raw" format data. Just the numbers separated by a single
           space.

       "-a"
           Return a Perl-style list of attributes suitable for passing to the
           "img()" method of the CGI module (see CGI).

       "-f" fmt
           Pass the string specified in fmt to "sprintf" and thus use it to
           format the results to your taste. "sprintf" will be passed two
           numbers, so any other formatting directives will be lost. The
           numbers are passed as width first, then height.

EXIT STATUS
       imgsize always exits
