NAME
       happrox  -  returns a simplified triangulation of a set of points using
       algorithm III of Garland and Heckbert (1995).

SYNOPSIS
       happrox [OPTIONS] < [input.pgm|input] > output.gts

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the happrox command.

OPTIONS
       This program follow the usual GNU command line syntax,  with  long  op-
       tions starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of options is included
       below.

       -n N, --number=N
              Stop the refinement process if the number of vertices is  larger
              than N.

       -c C, --cost=C
              Stop the refinement process if the cost of insertion of a vertex
              is smaller than C.

       -f, --flat
              Input is a flat file with three x,y,z columns  (default  is  PGM
              file).

       -r Z, --relative=Z
              Use relative height cost for all heights larger than Z.

       -k, --keep
              Keep enclosing triangle.

       -C, --closed
              Close the surface.

       -l, --log
              Log evolution of cost.

       -v, --verbose
              Display surface statistics.

       -h, --help
              Display the help and exit.
