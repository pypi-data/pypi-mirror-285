NAME
       paxctl - user-space utility to control PaX flags

SYNTAX
       paxctl <flags> <files>

DESCRIPTION
       paxctl  is  a tool that allows PaX flags to be modified on a per-binary
       basis.  PaX is part of common security-enhancing kernel patches and se-
       cure  distributions,  such  as  GrSecurity and Hardened Gentoo, respec-
       tively.  Your system needs to be running a properly patched and config-
       ured kernel for this program to have any effect.

       -P     enforce paging based non-executable pages (PAGEEXEC)

       -p     do not enforce paging based non-executable pages (NOPAGEEXEC)

       -E     emulate trampolines (EMUTRAMP)

       -e     do not emulate trampolines (NOEMUTRAMP)

       -M     enforce secure memory protections (MPROTECT)

       -m     do not enforce secure memory protections (NOMPROTECT)

       -R     randomize memory regions (RANDMMAP)

       -r     do not randomize memory regions (NORANDMMAP)

       -X     randomize  base  address  of  normal (ET_EXEC) executables (RAN-
              DEXEC)

       -x     do not randomize base address of  normal  (ET_EXEC)  executables
              (NORANDEXEC)

       -S     enforce segmentation based non-executable pages (SEGMEXEC)

       -s     do  not  enforce segmentation based non-executable pages (NOSEG-
              MEXEC)

       -v     view flags

       -z     reset all flags (further flags still apply)

       -c     create the PT_PAX_FLAGS program header if it does not  exist  by
              converting the PT_GNU_STACK program header if it exists

       -C     create  the  PT_PAX_FLAGS program header if it does not exist by
              adding a new program header, if it is possible

       -q     suppress error messages

       -Q     report flags in short format

CAVEATS
       The old PaX flag location and control method have  been  obsoleted,  if
       your kernel and binaries use it you have to use chpax(1) instead (it is
       recommended to use PT_PAX_FLAGS along with -c or -C however).

       Converting PT_GNU_STACK into PT_PAX_FLAGS means that the information in
       the former is destroyed, in particular you must make sure that the EMU-
       TRAMP PaX option is properly set in  the  newly  created  PT_PAX_FLAGS.
       The  secure  way  is to disable EMUTRAMP first and if PaX reports stack
       execution attempts from nested function trampolines then enable it.

       Note that the new PT_PAX_FLAGS is created in the same state that  binu-
       tils/ld itself would produce (equivalent to -zex).

       Note  that  if you use both PT_PAX_FLAGS and the extended attribute PaX
       flags on a binary then they must be exactly the same (except  for  RAN-
       DEXEC).

       Note  that RANDEXEC is no longer supported by PaX kernels since 2.6.13,
       the paxctl flags are simply ignored there.

       Note that paxctl does not make backup copies of the files it modifies.

       Note that paxctl is meant to work on the native architecture's binaries
       only,  however  it should work on foreign binaries as long as they have
       the same endianess as the native architecture  (e.g.,  an  i386  paxctl
       should  work  on  amd64 or little-endian arm but not on big-endian mips
       binaries).
