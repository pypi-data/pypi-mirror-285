NAME
       doveadm-instance - Manage the list of running Dovecot instances

SYNOPSIS
       doveadm [-Dv] [-f formatter] instance list
       doveadm [-Dv] instance remove name | base_dir

DESCRIPTION
       The  doveadm  instance  commands are used to manage the list of Dovecot
       instances running on the server.  In most installations there  is  only
       one  Dovecot  instance, but in some cases is may be useful to have more
       (e.g. running director proxy and backend in the same server).

       Instances are added to the list automatically when Dovecot is  started.
       Each  instance  is  uniquely  identified  by its base_dir setting.  In-
       stances can be named by setting instance_name in each instance's  dove-
       cot.conf.  When an instance is named, it can be accessed easily by giv-
       ing -i instance_name command line parameter for Dovecot binaries  (e.g.
       doveadm).

OPTIONS

       -D     Enables verbosity and debug messages.

       -f formatter
              Specifies  the  formatter  for formatting the output.  Supported
              formatters are:

              pager  prints each key: value pair on its own line and separates
                     records with form feed character (^L).

              tab    prints  a  table  header  followed by tab separated value
                     lines.

              table  prints a table header followed by adjusted value lines.

       -o setting=value
              Overrides  the  configuration  setting  from  /etc/dovecot/dove-
              cot.conf  and from the userdb with the given value.  In order to
              override multiple settings, the -o option may be specified  mul-
              tiple times.
