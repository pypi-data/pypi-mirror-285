NAME
       shtool-slo - GNU shtool separate linker options by library class

SYNOPSIS
       shtool slo [-p|--prefix str] -- -Ldir -llib [-Ldir -llib ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This command separates the linker options ``-L'' and ``-l'' by library
       class. It's argument line can actually be an arbitrary command line
       where those options are contained. slo parses these two options only
       and ignores the remaining contents. The result is a trivial shell
       script on "stdout" which defines six variables containing the ``-L''
       and ``-l'' options sorted by class:

       ``"SLO_DIRS_OBJ"'' and ``"SLO_LIBS_OBJ"'' contains the ``-L'' and
       ``-l'' options of static libraries,  ``"SLO_DIRS_PIC"'' and
       ``"SLO_LIBS_PIC"'' contains the ``-L'' and ``-l'' options of static
       libraries containing PIC ("Position Independent Code") and
       ``"SLO_DIRS_DSO"'' and ``"SLO_LIBS_DSO"'' contains the ``-L'' and
       ``-l'' options of shared libraries. The -p option can be used to change
       the default variable prefix from ""SLO_"" to str.

       The intent of this separation is to provide a way between static and
       shared libraries which is important if one wants to link custom DSOs
       against libraries, because not all platforms all one to link these DSOs
       against shared libraries. So one first has to separate out the shared
       libraries and link the DSO only against the static libraries.  One can
       use this command also to just sort the options.

OPTIONS
       The following command line options are available.

       -p, --prefix str
               FIXME

       -Ldir
           Directory where libraries are searched in.

       -llib
           Library to search for.

EXAMPLE
        #   configure.in
        LINK_STD="$LDFLAGS $LIBS"
        eval `shtool slo $LINK_STD`
        LINK_DSO="$SLO_DIRS_OBJ $SLO_LIBS_OBJ $SLO_DIRS_PIC $SLO_LIBS_PIC"

HISTORY

       Engelschall <rse@engelschall.com> in 1998 for Apache.  It was later
       taken over into GNU shtool.
