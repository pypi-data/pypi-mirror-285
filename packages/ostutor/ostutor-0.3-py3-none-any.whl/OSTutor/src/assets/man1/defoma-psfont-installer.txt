       printer.

SYNOPSIS
       defoma-psfont-installer

DESCRIPTION
       defoma-psfont-installer is a tool to  register  fonts  installed  in  a
       PostScript  printer  to  Defoma, Debian Font Manager. Those who want to
       print a PostScript file using the printer fonts may want  to  have  all
       the  printer fonts appear in a PostScript font selection menu of an ap-
       plication.  defoma-psfont-installer helps registering printer fonts. It
       can  parse  PPD  -- PostScript Printer Description -- file and retrieve
       available printer font names from the file, then presumes the hints ac-
       cording  to  each of the font name, and creates a hintfile and register
       them.  It is strongly recommended to prepare a PPD file.
