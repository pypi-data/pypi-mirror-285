NAME
       dh_quilt_unpatch - unapply patches listed in debian/patches/series

SYNOPSIS
       dh_quilt_unpatch [debhelper options]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_quilt_unpatch simply calls quilt pop -a after having set the
       environment variable QUILT_PATCHES to debian/patches.  All patches
       listed in debian/patches/series are then unapplied in the current
       directory. The command does not fail if the patches have already been
       unapplied.

       You can use another directory instead of debian/patches by setting (and
       exporting) the environment variable QUILT_PATCH_DIR.

EXAMPLES
       dh_quilt_unpatch is usually called indirectly in a rules file via the
       dh command.

               %:
                       dh $@ --with quilt

       It can also be direcly called in the clean rule.

               clean:
                       dh_testdir
                       dh_testroot
                       [ ! -f Makefile ] || $(MAKE) clean
                       dh_quilt_unpatch
                       dh_clean

NOTES
       This tool is useless if you use the source package format 3.0 (quilt).
       Consider switching to this source format if you haven't done it yet.
