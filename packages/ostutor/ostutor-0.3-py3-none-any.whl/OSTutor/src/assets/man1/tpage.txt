NAME
       Template::Tools::tpage - Process templates from command line

USAGE
           tpage [ --define var=value ] file(s)

DESCRIPTION
       The tpage script is a simple wrapper around the Template Toolkit
       processor.  Files specified by name on the command line are processed
       in turn by the template processor and the resulting output is sent to
       STDOUT and can be redirected accordingly.  e.g.

           tpage myfile > myfile.out
           tpage header myfile footer > myfile.html

       If no file names are specified on the command line then tpage will read
       STDIN for input.

       The "--define" option can be used to set the values of template
       variables.  e.g.

           tpage --define author="Andy Wardley" skeleton.pm > MyModule.pm

   The .tpagerc Configuration File
       You can use a .tpagerc file in your home directory.

       The purpose of this file is to set any global configuration options
       that you want applied every time tpage is run. For example, you can use
       the "include_path" to use template files from a generic template
       directory.

       Run "tpage -h" for a summary of the options available.

       See Template for general information about the Perl Template Toolkit
       and the template language and features.
