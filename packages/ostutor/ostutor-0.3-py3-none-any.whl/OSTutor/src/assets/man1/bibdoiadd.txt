NAME
       bibdoiadd.pl - add DOI numbers to papers in a given bib file

SYNOPSIS
       bibdoiadd [-c config_file] [-C 1|0] [-e 1|0] [-f] [-o output] bib_file

OPTIONS
       -c config_file
           Configuration file.  If this file is absent, some defaults are
           used.  See below for its format.

       -C 1|0
           Whether to canonize names in the output (1) or not (0).  By
           default, 1.

       -e  If 1 (default), add empty doi if a doi cannot be found.  This
           prevents repeated searches for the same entries if you add new
           entries to the file.  Calling "-e 0" suppresses this behavior.

       -f  Force checking doi number even if one is present

       -o output
           Output file.  If this option is not used, the name for the output
           file is formed by adding "_doi" to the input file

DESCRIPTION
       The script reads a BibTeX file.  It checks whether the entries have
       DOIs.  If not, it tries to contact http://www.crossref.org to get the
       corresponding DOI.  The result is a BibTeX file with the fields
       "doi=..." added.

       The name of the output file is either set by the -o option or is
       derived by adding the suffix "_doi" to the output file.

       There are two options for making queries with Crossref: free account
       and paid membership.  In the first case you still must register with
       Crossref and are limited to a small number of queries, see the
       agreement at
       "http://www.crossref.org/01company/free_services_agreement.html".  In
       the second case you have a username and password, and can use them for
       automatic queries.  I am not sure whether the use of this script is
       allowed for the free account holders.  Anyway if you try to add DOI to
       a large number of entries, you should register as a paid member.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       The configuration file is mostly self-explanatory: it has comments
       (starting with "#") and assginments in the form

          $field = value ;

       The important parameters are $mode ('free' or 'paid'), $email (for free
       users) and $username & $password for paid members.

EXAMPLES
          bibdoiadd -c bibdoiadd.cfg -o - citations.bib > result.bib
          bibdoiadd -c bibdoiadd.cfg -o result.bib citations.bib
