NAME
       doveadm-penalty - Show current penalties

SYNOPSIS
       doveadm [-Dv] penalty [-a anvil_socket_path] [ip[/mask]]

DESCRIPTION
       The  doveadm  penalty command can be used to see the current penalties.
       (Extend me!/explain it)

OPTIONS
       Global doveadm(1) options:

       -D     Enables verbosity and debug messages.

       -o setting=value
              Overrides  the  configuration  setting  from  /etc/dovecot/dove-
              cot.conf  and from the userdb with the given value.  In order to
              override multiple settings, the -o option may be specified  mul-
              tiple times.

       -v     Enables verbosity, including progress counter.

       Command specific options:

       -a anvil_socket_path
              This  option  is used to specify an alternative socket.  The op-
              tion's argument is either an absolute path to a local  UNIX  do-
              main socket, or a hostname and port (hostname:port), in order to
              connect a remote host via a TCP socket.

              By  default  doveadm(1)  will  use  the  socket   /var/run/dove-
              cot/anvil.  The socket may be located in another directory, when
              the  default  base_dir  setting  was  overridden  in  /etc/dove-
              cot/dovecot.conf.

ARGUMENTS
       ip[/mask]
              To  reduce/filter  the  output supply an IP address or a network
              range in CIDR notation (ip/mask).
