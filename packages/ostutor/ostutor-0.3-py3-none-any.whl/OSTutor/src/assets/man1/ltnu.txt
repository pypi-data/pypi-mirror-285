NAME
       ltnu - lists packages of a maintainer ordered by last upload

SYNOPSIS
       env DEBEMAIL=maintainer ltnu [-m]

       ltnu [-m] maintainer

       ltnu --help

DESCRIPTION
       ltnu (Long Time No Upload) queries the public mirror of the Ultimate
       Debian Database (udd-mirror.debian.net) for all uploads of packages by
       the given uploader or maintainer and displays them ordered by the last
       upload of that package to Debian Unstable, oldest uploads first.

       Its primary purpose is to check which of your own or your team's
       packages haven't been uploaded for a long time and likely need a
       packaging revamp. It's less suitable for MIA team purposes as it
       doesn't make a difference with regards to who actually uploaded a
       package.

OPTIONS
       -m  Only search in the Maintainer field and ignore the Uploaders field.

PARAMETERS
       The maintainer/uploader to query can be given either by setting
       $DEBEMAIL as environment variable or as single commandline parameter.

       If a commandline parameter does not contain an "@", "@debian.org" is
       appended, e.g. "ltnu abe" queries for "abe@debian.org".

       Exceptions are some shortcuts for common, long e-mail addresses. So far
       implemented shortcuts:

       pkg-gnustep  pkg-gnustep-maintainers@lists.alioth.debian.org

       pkg-perl     pkg-perl-maintainers@lists.alioth.debian.org

       pkg-zsh      pkg-zsh-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org

       qa           packages@qa.debian.org

ENVIRONMENT
       The following environment variables are honoured:

       DEBEMAIL
           Used for querying if no parameter is given.

       PAGER
           Used by psql as pager.

                    source          |     ver      |        uploaded

DEPENDENCIES
       ltnu uses the PostgreSQL client command psql and hence needs Debian's
       postgresql-client package to be installed.
