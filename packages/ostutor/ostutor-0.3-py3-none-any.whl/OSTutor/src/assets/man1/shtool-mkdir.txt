NAME
       shtool-mkdir - GNU shtool mkdir(1) style command

SYNOPSIS
       shtool mkdir [-t|--trace] [-f|--force] [-p|--parents] [-m|--mode mode]
       [-o|--owner owner] [-g|--group group] dir [dir ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This is a mkdir(1) style command with additional options and the
       ability to be smart if the directory already exists which is important
       for installation procedures.

OPTIONS
       The following command line options are available.

       -t, --trace
           Shows the actually involved shell commands.

       -f, --force
           Forced continuation and no complaints if directory already exists.
           Default is to terminate with error.

       -p, --parents
           Automatic parent directory creation. Default is to only create the
           last directory in the path and fail if parents are missing.

       -m, --mode mode
           The directory mode applied to the directory, see chmod(1). Omitting
           mode skips this step and leaves the operating system default which
           is usually based on umask(1). Some directory modes require
           superuser privileges to be set. Default is to stick with operating
           system defaults.

       -o, --owner owner
           The directory owner name or id applied to the directory, see
           chown(1).  This option requires superuser privileges to execute.
           Default is to skip this step and leave the operating system default
           which is usually based on the executing uid or the parent setuid
           directory.

       -g, --group group
           The directory group name or id applied to the directory, see
           chgrp(1). This option requires superuser privileges to execute to
           the fullest extend, otherwise the choice of group is limited on
           most operating systems.  Default is to skip this step and leave the
           operating system default which is usually based on the executing
           gid or the parent setgid directory.

EXAMPLE
        #   Makefile
        install:

            shtool mkdir -f -p -m 755 $(mandir)/man1
