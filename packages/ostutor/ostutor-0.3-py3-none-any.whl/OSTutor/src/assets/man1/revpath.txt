NAME
       revpath  -  generate a relative path that can be used to undo a change-
       directory

SYNOPSIS
       revpath path

DESCRIPTION
       The revpath program prints out a relative path that is the  ``reverse''
       or  ``inverse''  of  path.   Start with two directories top and bottom,
       with the latter below the former, and path is the  location  of  bottom
       relative to top.  The output of revpath is the location of top relative
       to bottom.  The resulting path contains a trailing `/'  character  when
       the result is non-trivial.  If path is equivalent to `.', the resulting
       output is empty.  If path is invalid in some way (e.g., doesn't  repre-
       sent  the path to a subdirectory) the output is also empty and no error
       messages are ever generated.

DIAGNOSTICS
       There are no diagnostics.  Error conditions are silently  ignored,  and
       the exit status is always 0.

BUGS
       It isn't possible to reverse arbitrary relative paths.  If any path el-
       ement between the two end points of path is a symbolic  link,  the  re-
       sults will probably be incorrect.
