NAME
       bibtexu - UTF-8 Big BibTeX

SYNOPSIS
       bibtexu [options] aux-file

DESCRIPTION
       BibTeXu  is  the  Unicode-compliant  version  of BibTeX.  It is largely
       based on Niel Kempson's BibTeX8, and it provides a better  support  for
       UTF-8  by  integrating  ICU  library.  Therefore, BibTeXu no longer re-
       quires the Codepage and Sort order ("CS") file; instead, the method  of
       sorting and case-changing can be controled via command-line options.
