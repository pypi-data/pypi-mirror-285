DESCRIPTION
       defoma-font  is a tool to register or unregister font(s) to Defoma, De-
       bian Font Manager. Defoma then calls Defoma-configuration-scripts  pro-
       vided  by  applications to make the font(s) configured for the applica-
       tions which can make use of them. It is  supposed  to  be  called  from
       postinst  and  prerm  scripts,  but may be called from console for not-
       packaged addon fonts.

       There are two methods of registering/unregistering font(s): by specify-
       ing  one  font  with its hints, or through a hintfile , which describes
       several fonts with their hints.  Font packages  may  possibly  use  the
       latter  method,  installing a hintfile under /etc/defoma/hints as conf-
       file.  The latter method has '-all' added in the commands.

       category specifies the category of a font like type1, truetype  and  so
       on.   font  specifies  the font itself and is either a full path to the
       font, or a logical font name.  hints specify the  hints  of  the  font,
       which  contain essential information of the font like FontName, Charset
       and Encoding, appearance information of the font representing its  face
       like Weight, Shape, GeneralFamily and Width, and additional information
       of the font like Alias and Priority.

COMMANDS
       register
              Register the specified font with the specified  hints  into  the
              specified category unless the font is already registered.

       unregister
              Unregister  the  specified font which must be already registered
              in the specified category.  If the font is marked as use or  ex-
              clude  in  an  Id  cache of a certain application, the marks are
              left intact.

       reregister
              If the specified font  is  already  registered,  the  registered
              hints  and the specified hints are compared. If these hints dif-
              fers, the font first gets unregistered and then newly registered
              with  the  specified  new hints.  If the font is not registered,
              following process is the same as register command.

       purge  This command is almost the same as  unregister  command,  except
              that this command removes the marks in an Id cache.

       register-all

       unregister-all

       reregister-all

       purge-all
              These  commands  operate  all the fonts written in the specified
              hintfile.

OPTIONS
       -t     Exit with true value (0) even if error occurs.

       -v     Verbose output.

       -d     More verbose output.

       -q     Quiet output.
