NAME
       mkpasswd - Overfeatured front end to crypt(3)

SYNOPSIS
       mkpasswd PASSWORD [SALT]

DESCRIPTION
       mkpasswd  encrypts  the given password with the crypt(3) libc function,
       using the given salt.

OPTIONS
       -S, --salt=STRING
              Use the STRING as salt. If it begins with  $  then  it  will  be
              passed straight to crypt(3) without any checks.

       -R, --rounds=NUMBER
              Use NUMBER rounds. This argument is ignored if the method chosen
              does not support  variable  rounds.  For  the  OpenBSD  Blowfish
              method  this  is the logarithm of the number of rounds.  The be-
              havior is undefined if this option is used without --method.

       -m, --method=TYPE
              Compute the password using the TYPE method.   If  TYPE  is  help
              then  the  list of available methods is printed.  If TYPE begins
              and  end  with  $  characters  then  the  string  is  passed  to
              crypt_gensalt(3) as-is.

       -5     Like --method=md5crypt.

       -P NUM, --password-fd=NUM
              Read the password from file descriptor NUM instead of using get-
              pass(3).  If the file descriptor is not connected to a tty  then
              no other text than the hashed password is printed on stdout.

       -s, --stdin
              Like --password-fd=0.

ENVIRONMENT
       MKPASSWD_OPTIONS
              A list of options which will be evaluated before the ones speci-
              fied on the command line.

BUGS
       If the --stdin option is used then passwords  containing  some  control
       characters may not be read correctly.

       This programs suffers of a bad case of featuritis.
