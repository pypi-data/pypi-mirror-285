NAME
       dh_pycentral - use the python-central framework to handle Python
       modules and extensions

SYNOPSIS
       dh_pycentral [debhelper options] [-n] [-Xitem] [-V version]
       [module dirs ...]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_pycentral is a debhelper program that will scan your package, detect
       public Python modules and move them in /usr/share/pycentral so that
       python-central can byte-compile those for all supported Python
       versions.  Extensions are kept into the original installation location.

       Moving the files to the pycentral location and adding symbolic links to
       /usr/lib/pythonX.Y/*-packages can be done by setting the environment
       varibale DH_PYCENTRAL to a string containing the string include-links.

       Moving the files to the pycentral location can be disabled by setting
       the environment varibale DH_PYCENTRAL to a string containing the string
       nomove.

       The functionality to shorten the time of unavailabilty of files during
       unpack and configure has been removed (symlinking files in the preinst
       and not removing the symlinked files on upgrade) in version 0.6.9.

       You must have filled the XS-Python-Version header to indicate the set
       of python versions that are going to be supported. dh_pycentral expects
       the XB-Python-Version for each binary package it is supposed to work
       on.

       dh_pycentral will also generate substitution variables: the
       ${python:Provides} variable will contain versioned provides of the
       package (if the package's name starts with "python-"). A python-foo
       package could provide "python2.3-foo" and "python2.4-foo" at the same
       time. Python extensions have to provide those whereas it's only option
       for pure python modules.

       The ${python:Versions} variable should be used to provide the required
       XB-Python-Version field listing the python versions supported by the
       package.

OPTIONS
       module dirs
           If your package installs python modules in non-standard
           directories, you can make dh_pycentral check those directories by
           passing their names on the command line. By default, it will check
           /usr/lib/$PACKAGE, /usr/share/$PACKAGE, /usr/lib/games/$PACKAGE,
           /usr/share/games/$PACKAGE, /usr/lib/python?.?/site-packages and
           /usr/lib/python?.?/dist-packages.

           Note: only /usr/lib/python?.?/site-packages and the extra names on
           the command line are searched for binary (.so) modules.

       -V version
           If the .py files your package ships are meant to be used by a
           specific pythonX.Y version, you can use this option to specify the
           desired version, such as 2.3. Do not use if you ship modules in
           /usr/lib/site-python.

           With the new policy, this option is mostly deprecated. Use the XS-
           Python-Field to indicate that you're using a specific python
           version.

       -n, --noscripts
           Do not modify postinst/postrm scripts.

       -Xitem, --exclude=item
           Exclude files that contain "item" anywhere in their filename from
           being taken into account to generate the python dependency. You may
           use this option multiple times to build up a list of things to
           exclude.

CONFORMS TO
       Python policy, version 0.4.1 (2006-06-20)
