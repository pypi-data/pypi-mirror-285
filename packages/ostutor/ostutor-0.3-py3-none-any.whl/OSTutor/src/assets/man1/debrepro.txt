NAME
       debrepro - reproducibility tester for Debian packages

SYNOPSIS
       debrepro [OPTIONS] [SOURCEDIR]

DESCRIPTION
       debrepro will build a given source directory twice, with a set of
       variations between the first and the second build, and compare the
       produced binary packages. If diffoscope is installed, it is used to
       compare non-matching binaries. If disorderfs is installed, it is used
       during the build to inject non-determinism in filesystem listing
       operations.

       SOURCEDIR must be a directory containing an unpacked Debian source
       package. If SOURCEDIR is omitted, the current directory is assumed.

OUTPUT DIRECTORY
       At the very end of a build, debrepro will inform the location of the
       output directory where the build artifacts can be found. In that
       directory, you will find:

       $OUTPUTDIR/first
           Contains the results of the first build, including a copy of the
           source tree, and the resulting binary packages.

       $OUTPUTDIR/first/build.sh
           Contains the exact build script that was used in the first build.

       $OUTPUTDIR/second
           Contains the results of the second build, including a copy of the
           source tree, and the resulting binary packages.

       $OUTPUTDIR/second/build.sh
           Contains the exact build script that was used in the second build.

       Taking a diff(1) between $OUTPUTDIR/first/build.sh and
       $OUTPUTDIR/second/build.sh is an excellent way of figuring out exactly
       what changed between the two builds.

SUPPORTED VARIATIONS
       user
           The $USER environment variable will contain different values
           between the first and second builds.

       path
           During the second build, a fake, non-existing directory will be
           appended to the $PATH environment variable.

       umask
           The builds will use different umask settings.

       locale
           Both $LC_ALL and $LANG will be different across the two builds.

       timezone
           $TZ will be different across builds.

       filesystem-ordering
           If disorderfs is installed, both builds will be done under a
           disorderfs overlay directory. This will cause filesystem listing
           operations to be return items in a non-deterministic order.

       time
           The second build will be executed 213 days, 7 hours and 13 minutes
           in the future with regards to the current time (using faketime(1)).

OPTIONS
       -s VARIATION, --skip VARIATION
           Don't perform the named VARIATION. Variation names are the ones
           used in their description in section SUPPORTED VARIATIONS.

       -b COMMAND, --before-second-build COMMAND
           Run COMMAND before performing the second build. This can be used
           for example to apply a patch to a source tree for the second build,
           and check whether (or how) the resulting binaries are affected.

           Examples:

             $ debrepro --before-second-build "git checkout branch-with-changes"

             $ debrepro --before-second-build "patch -p1 < /path/to/patch"

       -h, --help
           Display this help message and exit.

EXIT STATUS
       0   Package is reproducible.

           Reproducible here means that the two builds produced the exactly
           the same binaries, under the set of variations that debrepro tests.
           Other sources of non-determinism in builds that are not yet tested
           might still affect builds in the wild.

       1   Package is not reproducible.

       2   The given input is not a valid Debian source package.

       3   Required programs are missing.
