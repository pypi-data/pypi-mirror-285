FILES
       /etc/python/debian_config  is  searched for the attribute overwrite-lo-
       cal.    If    set    to    1,    or    True,    existing    files    in
       /usr/lib/pythonX.Y/*-packages  are  overwritten  with symbolic links to
       the pycentral install area. The default is to abort the installation of
       a package, when files already exist. This behaviour may be useful, when
       python libraries were manually installed into this directory.  The  at-
       tribute byte-compile can be set to a comma separated list of the values
       standard and optimze to indicate how files should be byte-compiled.
