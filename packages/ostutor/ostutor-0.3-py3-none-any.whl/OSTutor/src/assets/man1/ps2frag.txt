NAME
       ps2frag - obsolete shell script for the PSfrag system.

IMPORTANT NOTICE
       The  new  PSfrag system no longer requires the ps2frag script; instead,
       it handles the processing entirely within TeX/LaTeX and DVIPS. I'm sure
       you will agree that never needing to run ps2frag again is a nice conve-
       nience!

       However, there are two significant differences in the way this new ver-
       sion of PSfrag works. Please make yourself aware of them:

       1)  XDvi  is no longer able to determine where your PSfrag replacements
       should go, so instead it lines them up in a vertical list to  the  left
       of  the  figure. This allows you to confirm that they have been typeset
       properly, at least. However, to confirm that PSfrag positions your  re-
       placements  properly,  you  will have to view the PostScript version of
       your file with a viewer like GhostView, or print it out.  This seems to
       be the only disadvantage to the elimination of the pre-processing step.

       2)  If  you  embed '\tex' commands inside your figures, you now need to
       explicitly _tell_ PSfrag to process  these  commands.  To  do  so,  use
       \usepackage[scanall]{psfrag}  instead of \usepackage{psfrag} at the be-
       ginning of your LaTeX file.

       If you only use '\tex' commands in a small number of  figures,  then  a
       more  efficient might be to turn on '\tex'-scanning only for those fig-
       ures. To do that, add the command  '\psfragscanon'  immediately  before
       each relevant \includegraphics or \epsfbox command.

NOTES
       See the PSfrag documentation for further information.
