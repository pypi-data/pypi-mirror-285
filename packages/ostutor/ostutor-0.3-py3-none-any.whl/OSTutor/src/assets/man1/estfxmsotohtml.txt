DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the hyperestraier filter programs.

       These  programs  are  called as filter programs when construting an in-
       verted index. Their functions are to read data from  a  file  specified
       with  the  first  argument,  and  convert the data to document draft or
       html, and write the result to a file specified with  the  second  argu-
       ment.

       estfxasis just passes input contents to output.

       estfxmantotxt  converts manual pages into plain text, so that it is ex-
       pected to use "T@" prefix for estcmd filter spec. It depends man,  bsd-
       mainutils and coreutils.

       estfxmsotohtml  converts  MS-Word, MS-Excel or MS-PowerPoint into html,
       so that it is expected to use "H@" prefix for estcmd  filter  spec.  It
       depends on wvWare, xlhtml or ppthtml.

       estfxpdftohtml  converts  PDF  into html, so that it is expected to use
       "H@" prefix for estcmd filter spec. It depends on pdftotext.
