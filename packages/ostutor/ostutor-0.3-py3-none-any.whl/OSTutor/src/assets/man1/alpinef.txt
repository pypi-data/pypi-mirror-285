DESCRIPTION
       Alpine is a screen-oriented message-handling tool.  In its default con-
       figuration, Alpine offers an intentionally  limited  set  of  functions
       geared toward the novice user, but it also has a large list of optional
       "power-user" and personal-preference features.  alpinef is a variant of
       Alpine  that uses function keys rather than mnemonic single-letter com-
       mands.  Alpine's basic feature set includes:

              View, Save, Export, Delete, Print, Reply and Forward messages.

              Compose messages in a simple editor (Pico) with word-wrap and  a
              spelling  checker.   Messages may be postponed for later comple-
              tion.

              Full-screen selection and management of message folders.

              Address book to keep a  list  of  long  or  frequently-used  ad-
              dresses.  Personal distribution lists may be defined.  Addresses
              may be taken into the address book from  incoming  mail  without
              retyping them.

              New  mail  checking  and notification occurs automatically every
              2.5 minutes and  after  certain  commands,  e.g.  refresh-screen
              (Ctrl-L).

              On-line, context-sensitive help screens.

       Alpine supports MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions), an Inter-
       net Standard for representing multipart and multimedia data  in  email.
       Alpine allows you to save MIME objects to files, and in some cases, can
       also initiate the correct program for viewing the object.  It uses  the
       system's  mailcap  configuration  file  to  determine  what program can
       process a particular MIME object type.  Alpine's message composer  does
       not  have  integral  multimedia  capability,  but any type of data file
       --including multimedia-- can be attached to a text message and sent us-
       ing  MIME's  encoding rules.  This allows any group of individuals with
       MIME-capable mail software (e.g. Alpine, PC-Alpine, or many other  pro-
       grams)  to  exchange  formatted  documents, spread-sheets, image files,
       etc, via Internet email.

       Alpine uses the c-client messaging API to access local and remote  mail
       folders.  This library provides a variety of low-level message-handling
       functions, including drivers for a variety of different mail file  for-
       mats, as well as routines to access remote mail and news servers, using
       IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) and NNTP (Network  News  Trans-
       port  Protocol).   Outgoing  mail  is  usually posted directly via SMTP
       (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).

OPTIONS
       The command line options/arguments are:

       address             Send mail to address.  This will cause Alpine to go
                           directly into the message composer.

       -attach file        Send mail with the listed file as an attachment.

       -attachlist file-list
                           Send  mail  with the listed file-list as an attach-
                           ments.

       -attach_and_delete file
                           Send mail with the listed file  as  an  attachment,
                           and remove the file after the message is sent.

       -aux local_directory
                           PC-Alpine  only.  When using a remote configuration
                           (-p <remote_config>) this tells PC-Alpine the local
                           directory  to use for storing auxiliary files, like
                           debug files, address books, and signature files.

       -bail               Exit if the pinerc file does not exist. This  might
                           be useful if the config file is accessed using some
                           remote filesystem protocol. If the remote mount  is
                           missing  this  will cause Alpine to quit instead of
                           creating a new pinerc.

       -c context-number   context-number is the number corresponding  to  the
                           folder-collection  to which the -f command line ar-
                           gument should be applied.  By default the -f  argu-
                           ment is applied to the first defined folder-collec-
                           tion.

       -conf               Produce a sample/fresh copy of the system-wide con-
                           figuration file, pine.conf, on the standard output.
                           This is distinct from the per-user .pinerc file.

       -convert_sigs -p pinerc
                           Convert signature files into literal signatures.

       -copy_abook <local_abook> <remote_abook>
                           Copy the local address book file to  a  remote  ad-
                           dress book folder.

       -copy_pinerc <local_pinerc> <remote_pinerc>
                           Copy  the  local  pinerc  file  to  a remote pinerc
                           folder.

       -d debug-level      Output diagnostic info at debug-level (0-9) to  the
                           current  .pine-debug[1-4] file.  A value of 0 turns
                           debugging off and suppresses the .pine-debug file.

       -d key[=val]        Fine tuned  output  of  diagnostic  messages  where
                           "flush"  causes  debug file writing without buffer-

                           ing an inverse threshold for message output.

       -f folder           Open folder (in first  defined  folder  collection,
                           use  -c n to specify another collection) instead of
                           INBOX.

       -F file             Open  named  text  file  and  view  with   Alpine's
                           browser.

       -h                  Help: list valid command-line options.

       -i                  Start up in the FOLDER INDEX screen.

       -I keystrokes       Initial  (comma separated list of) keystrokes which
                           Alpine should execute on startup.

       -install            For PC-Alpine only, this option causes PC-Alpine to
                           prompt  for  some basic setup information, then ex-
                           its.

       -k                  Use function keys for commands. This is the same as
                           running the command alpinef.

       -n number           Start up with current message-number set to number.

       -nowrite_password_cache
                           Read  from  a  password  cache if there is one, but
                           never offer to write a password to the cache

       -o                  Open first folder read-only.

       -p config-file      Use config-file as the personal configuration  file
                           instead of the default .pinerc.

       -P config-file      Use  config-file  as the configuration file instead
                           of   default   system-wide    configuration    file
                           pine.conf.

       -passfile <fully-qualified-path>
                           When  password file support is compiled in, use the
                           file specified in <fully-qualified-path> instead of
                           the default.

       -pinerc file        Output fresh pinerc configuration to file, preserv-
                           ing the settings of variables  that  the  user  has
                           made.   Use  file set to ``-'' to make output go to
                           standard out.

       -pwdcertdir <fully-qualified-path>
                           When SMIME and password file support  are  compiled
                           in,  this variable sets the directory to store your
                           personal key and certificate to encrypt and decrypt
                           your password file.

       -r                  Use  restricted/demo  mode.   Alpine will only send
                           mail to itself and functions like save  and  export
                           are restricted.

       -registry cmd       For  PC-Alpine only, this option affects the values
                           of Alpine's registry entries.  Possible values  for
                           cmd  are set, clear, and dump.  Set will always re-
                           set Alpine's registry entries according to its cur-
                           rent  settings.  Clear will clear the registry val-
                           ues.  Clearsilent will silently clear the  registry
                           values.   Dump  will  display the values of current
                           registry settings.  Note that the dump  command  is
                           currently  disabled.  Without the -registry option,
                           PC-Alpine will write values into the registry  only
                           if there currently aren't any values set.

       -smimedir <fully-qualified-path>
                           If SMIME is compiled in, this argument sets the di-
                           rectory where the public, private, and  certificate
                           authorities  certificates  and  keys are stored. If
                           not  set  by  the  command  line  the  default   is
                           ~/.alpine-smime

       -sort order         Sort the FOLDER INDEX display in one of the follow-
                           ing orders: arrival,  date,  subject,  orderedsubj,
                           thread,  from, size, score, to, cc, or reverse. Ar-
                           rival order is the default.  The OrderedSubj choice
                           simulates  a  threaded  sort.   Any sort may be re-
                           versed by adding /reverse to it.  Reverse by itself
                           is the same as arrival/reverse.

       -supported          Some  options may or may not be supported depending
                           on how Alpine was compiled.  This is a way  to  de-
                           termine which options are supported in the particu-
                           lar copy of Alpine you are using.

       -uninstall          For PC-Alpine only, this option causes PC-Alpine to
                           remove references to Alpine in Windows settings.

       -url url            Open  the  given url.  Cannot be used with -f or -F
                           options.

       -v                  Version: Print version information.

       -version            Version: Print version information.

       -x config           Use configuration exceptions in config.  Exceptions
                           are  used  to override your default pinerc settings
                           for a particular platform, can be a local file or a
                           remote folder.

       -xoauth2-server ServerName
                           Name  of  the  service  that XOAUTH2 authentication
                           will be attempted.  The only service  supported  as
                           of  this writing is Gmail. Note that all of the op-
                           tions   -xoauth2-server,   -xoauth2-client-id   and
                           -xoauth2-client-secret must be used simultaneously.
                           Example: -xoauth2-server Gmail.

       -xoauth2-client-id Client-Id
                           String that  identifies  Alpine  with  the  service
                           provider that provides XOAUTH2 authentication. Note
                           that   all   of   the   options    -xoauth2-server,
                           -xoauth2-client-id  and -xoauth2-client-secret must
                           be used simultaneously.

       -xoauth2-client-secret Client-Secret
                           Secret string that identifies the Alpine  with  the
                           service  provider that provides XOAUTH2 authentica-
                           tion.    Note   that    all    of    the    options
                           -xoauth2-server,       -xoauth2-client-id       and
                           -xoauth2-client-secret must be used simultaneously.

       -z                  Enable ^Z and SIGTSTP so alpine may be suspended.

       -option=value       Assign value to the config option option e.g. -sig-
                           nature-file=sig1 or -feature-list=signature-at-bot-
                           tom (Note: feature-list values are additive)

CONFIGURATION
       There are several levels of Alpine configuration.  Configuration values
       at  a  given  level over-ride corresponding values at lower levels.  In
       order of increasing precedence:

        o built-in defaults.
        o system-wide pine.conf file.
        o personal .pinerc file (may be set via built-in Setup/Config menu.)
        o command-line options.
        o system-wide pine.conf.fixed file.

       There is one exception to the rule that configuration  values  are  re-
       placed by the value of the same option in a higher-precedence file: the
       feature-list variable has values that are additive, but can be  negated
       by prepending "no-" in front of an individual feature name. Unix Alpine
       also uses the following environment variables:

         TERM
         DISPLAY     (determines if Alpine can display IMAGE attachments.)
         SHELL       (if not set, default is /bin/sh )
         MAILCAPS    (semicolon delimited list of path names to mailcap files)
