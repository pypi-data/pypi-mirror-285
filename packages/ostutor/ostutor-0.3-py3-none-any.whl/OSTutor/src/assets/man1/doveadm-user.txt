NAME
       doveadm-user - Perform a user lookup in Dovecot's userdbs

SYNOPSIS
       doveadm   [-Dv]  user  [-a  userdb_socket_path]  [-f  field]  [-u]  [-x
       auth_info] user ...

DESCRIPTION
       The user command is used to perform a user lookup - to show what infor-
       mation  Dovecot  sees  about the user(s), or if it exists at all in the
       configured userdb(s).

       The auth_info may be useful when the userdb is for example a SQL  data-
       base  and  you  are  using %variables, like %s or %l, in the user_query
       setting.  Or when you have configured the userdb in a way like this:

       userdb {
         driver = passwd-file
         args = /etc/%s.passwd
       }

OPTIONS
       Global doveadm(1) options:

       -D     Enables verbosity and debug messages.

       -o setting=value
              Overrides  the  configuration  setting  from  /etc/dovecot/dove-
              cot.conf  and from the userdb with the given value.  In order to
              override multiple settings, the -o option may be specified  mul-
              tiple times.

       -v     Enables verbosity, including progress counter.

       Command specific options:

       -a userdb_socket_path
              This  option  is used to specify an absolute path to an alterna-
              tive UNIX domain socket.

              By  default  doveadm(1)  will  use  the  socket   /var/run/dove-
              cot/auth-userdb.   The  socket  may be located in another direc-
              tory, when  the  default  base_dir  setting  was  overridden  in
              /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf.

       -f field
              When  this  option  and  the  name  of  a userdb field is given,
              doveadm(1) will show only the value of the specified field.

       -u     When this option is given, doveadm(1) will only show values from
              the  userdb.   Without -u parameter if any of the uid, gid, home
              or mail fields are missing, their defaults are taken  from  con-
              figuration file.

       -x auth_info
              auth_info  specifies additional conditions for the user command.
              The auth_info option string has to be given as name=value  pair.
              For multiple conditions the -x option could be supplied multiple
              times.
              Possible names for the auth_info are:

              service
                     The service for which the userdb lookup should be tested.
                     The  value  may  be  the name of a service, commonly used
                     with Dovecot.  For example: imap, pop3 or smtp.

              lip    The local IP address (server) for the test.

              rip    The remote IP address (client) for the test.

              lport  The local port, e.g. 143

              rport  The remote port, e.g. 24567

ARGUMENTS
       user   Is a user's login name.  Depending on the configuration, a login
              name  may  be  for  example jane or john@example.com.  It's also
              possible to use '*' and '?' wildcards (e.g. -u *@example.org).

EXAMPLE
       Perform a user lookup for the users jane and john@example.com.

       doveadm user jane john@example.com
       userdb: jane
         uid       : 8001
         gid       : 8001
         home      : /home/jane
         mail      : sdbox:~/sdbox
         plugins   : sieve
         quota_rule: *:storage=150M

       userdb: john@example.com
         home      : /srv/mail/8/70312/79832
         uid       : 79832
         gid       : 70312
         mail      : mdbox:~/mdbox

       The next example shows a user lookup, using wildcards.

       doveadm user *.?oe@example.net
       jane.doe@example.net
       judy.roe@example.net
       john.doe@example.net
