DESCRIPTION
       The  mewstunnel  utility  is  a wrapper script for using stunnel.  This
       command is necessary for the mew-ssl feature to keep a process of stun-
       nel.   The  options  are  for  stunnel4 or stunnel.  If stunnel4 is in-
       stalled, it is executed.  If stunnel4 is not installed, stunnel is exe-
       cuted.  If the MEW_PROG_STUNNEL environment variable is set, it is exe-
       cuted instead.

       Note that stunnel 5.x is provided by the stunnel4 package in Debian.
