SYNOPSIS
       For help:

         sqlt-diff -h|--help

       For a list of all valid parsers:

         sqlt -l|--list

       To diff two schemas:

         sqlt-diff [options] file_name1=parser1 file_name2=parser2

       Options:

         -d|--debug   Show debugging info

         --ignore-index-names    Ignore index name differences
         --ignore-constraint-names   Ignore constraint name differences
         --mysql_parser_version=<#####> Specify a target MySQL parser version
                                        for dealing with /*! comments
         --output-db=<Producer>  This Producer will be used instead of one
                                 corresponding to parser1 to format output
                                 for new tables
         --ignore-view-sql    Ignore view SQL differences

         --no-batch-alters    Do not clump multile alters to the same table into a

                              names in statements

DESCRIPTION
       sqlt-diff is a utility for creating a file of SQL commands necessary to
       transform the first schema provided to the second.  While not yet
       exhaustive in its ability to mutate the entire schema, it will report
       the following

       o   New tables

           Using the Producer class of the target (second) schema, any tables
           missing in the first schema will be generated in their entirety
           (fields, constraints, indices).

       o   Missing/altered fields

           Any fields missing or altered between the two schemas will be
           reported as:

             ALTER TABLE <table_name>
               [DROP <field_name>]
               [CHANGE <field_name> <datatype> (<size>)] ;

       o   Missing/altered indices

           Any indices missing or of a different type or on different fields
           will be indicated.  Indices that should be dropped will be reported
           as such:

             DROP INDEX <index_name> ON <table_name> ;

           An index of a different type or on different fields will be
           reported as a new index as such:

             CREATE [<index_type>] INDEX [<index_name>] ON <table_name>
               ( <field_name>[,<field_name>] ) ;

       ALTER, CREATE, DROP statements are created by
       SQL::Translator::Producer::*, see there for support/problems.

       Currently (v0.0900), only MySQL is supported by this code.
