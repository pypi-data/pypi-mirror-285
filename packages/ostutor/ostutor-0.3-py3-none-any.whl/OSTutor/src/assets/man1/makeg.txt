NAME
       makeg - make a debuggable executable

SYNOPSIS
       makeg [ make-options ...  ] [ targets ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  makeg  script  runs make, passing it variable settings to create a
       debuggable target when used with a Makefile generated  by  imake.   For
       example,  it  arranges  for the C compiler to be called with the -g op-
       tion.

ENVIRONMENT
       MAKE    The make program to use.  Default ``make''.

       GDB     Set to a non-null value if using the gdb debugger on Solaris 2,
               which requires additional debugging options to be passed to the
               compiler.
