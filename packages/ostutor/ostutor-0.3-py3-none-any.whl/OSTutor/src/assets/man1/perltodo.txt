NAME
       perltodo - Link to the Perl to-do list

DESCRIPTION
       The Perl 5 to-do list is maintained in the git repository, and can be
       viewed at
       <http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/blob/HEAD:/Porting/todo.pod>

       (The to-do list used to be here in perltodo. That has stopped, as
       installing a snapshot that becomes increasingly out of date isn't that
       useful to anyone.)
