NAME
       shtool-version - GNU shtool maintain version information file

SYNOPSIS
       shtool version [-l|--language lang] [-n|--name name] [-p|--prefix
       prefix] [-s|--set version] [-e|--edit] [-i|--increase knob]
       [-d|--display type] file

DESCRIPTION
       This command displays and maintains version information in file.

       The version is always described with a triple <version,revision,level>
       and is represented by a string which always matches the regular
       expression ""[0-9]+\.[0-9]+[sabp.][0-9]+"".

       The hexadecimal format for a version "v.rtl" is "VVRRTLL" where "VV"
       and "RR" directly correspond to "v" and "r", "T" encodes the level type
       as 9, 2, 1, 0 (representing "s", "p"/".", "b", "a" in this order) and
       "LL" is either directly corresponding to "l" or set to 99 if level type
       is "s".
