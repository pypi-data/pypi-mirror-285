NAME
       makejvf - Make Japanese VF file from Japanese TeX TFM file

SYNOPSIS
       makejvf [<options>] <TeX TFM file> <PS font TFM>

DESCRIPTION
       makejvf  is  a  tool to generate Japanese VF file from Japanese TeX TFM
       (JFM) file for use with dvips.

       When processing Japanese texts, pTeX refers to JFM (min10.tfm,  jis.tfm
       etc.),  which  includes  definitions of some different character widths
       and metric glue/kerns. For most punctuations and quotation  marks,  the
       character  widths  are  truncated to less than 1 zw (zenkaku-width; the
       width of ordinary Kanji characters), and metric glue/kerns are inserted
       as a substitute.

       On the other hand, in Japanese PS fonts, all punctuations and quotation
       marks have the same character widths as ordinary Kanji characters.  For
       this  reason,  when dvips processes the resulting DVI, these characters
       have to be shifted to the left by the amount of glue/kerns inserted.

       To achieve this, Virtual fonts (VF) and PS TFM files are required; When
       VF  contains  the commands of shifting characters, PS font TFM can have
       the exact character widths of PS fonts.

       The program makejvf can be used for this purpose. It inputs a pTeX  JFM
       file  (refered  to  as <TeX TFM file> in SYNOPSIS above), and outputs a
       corresponding VF file (with the same basename as <TeX TFM file>) and  a
       JFM file for a PS font JFM file (<PS font TFM> above).

OPTIONS
       -C        Condensed ("Cho-tai") mode.

       -K <PS-TFM>
                 Map  Kana  (more exactly, non-Kanji) characters to another PS
                 font JFM named <PS-TFM>.

       -b <integer>
                 Base line shift amount; the  integer  represents  a  relative
                 value,  using the character height as a base of 1000.  When a
                 positive integer is specified, the  characters  are  lowered.
                 When  a  negative  integer  is  specified, the characters are
                 raised.

       -m        Replace single/double  quotation  marks  (',  '')  with  sin-
                 gle/double prime quotation marks (so-called "minute") in ver-
                 tical writing.  The replacement is realized  by  manipulating
                 glyphs of prime and double prime (JIS 0x216C and 0x216D; Uni-
                 code U+2032 and U+2033), not by  putting  actual  glyphs  de-
                 signed    for    quotation    marks   (Unicode   U+301D   and
                 U+301E/U+301F).

       -a <AFMfile>
                 Name of the input AFM file used for  Kana-tsume  mode.   This
                 option is unsupported.

       -k <integer>
                 Kana-tsume  (narrower  spaces between Kana characters) margin
                 amount; the integer represents a relative  value,  using  the
                 character  width as a base of 1000. This option should be ac-
                 companied with -a option.  This option is unsupported.

       -i        Start mapped font ID from No. 0 in  output  VF  (by  default,
                 makejvf defaults to No. 1).

       -e        Enhanced mode; the horizontal shift amount is determined from
                 the glue/kern table of input JFM file.

       By default, makejvf uses the hard-coded value as the  horizontal  shift
       amount,  which  is (mostly) optimized for Japanese fonts. When enhanced
       mode (option -e) is enabled, the shift amount is  determined  from  the
       input  pTeX  TFM (JFM) file, which is likely to output most suitable VF
       for the JFM.

       For most standard Japanese JFM (like jis.tfm and its derivatives),  the
       output  VFs  from  both  modes will have no significant difference. For
       simplified/traditional Chinese JFM  (like  upschrm-h.tfm  and  uptchrm-
       h.tfm),  the output VF from enhanced mode will be better. For min10.tfm
       and its derivatives, enhanced mode should never be enabled,  since  the
       characterization in min10.tfm is non-standard.

       -t <CNFfile>
                 Use <CNFfile> as a configuration file.

       -u <Charset>
                 UCS  mode.  Available  charsets are: gb (GB = Simplified Chi-
                 nese), cns (CNS = Traditional Chinese), ks (KS = Korean), jis
                 (JIS = Japanese), jisq (JIS quote only), custom (user-defined
                 CHARSET from <CNFfile>; see CONFIGURATION  FILE  FORMAT  sec-
                 tion).

       Options below are effective only in UCS mode:

       -J <PS-TFM>
                 Map single/double quote to another JIS-encoded PSfont TFM.

       -U <PS-TFM>
                 Map single/double quote to another UCS-encoded PSfont TFM.

       -3        Use  set3,  that  is, enable non-BMP characters support (with
                 UCS mode).  By default makejvf does not output >=U+10000,  to
                 reduce  file size and to avoid problems with old DVI drivers.
                 Recent versions of dvipdfmx and others  can  handle  VF  with
                 >=U+10000  (=  set3  in  DVI language), therefore -3 might be
                 helpful.

       -H        Use half-width Katakana.

EXAMPLE
       If you want to use min10 as Ryumin-Light-H, run
                 makejvf min10.tfm rml

       This generates min10.vf and rml.tfm. Put these files in an  appropriate
       directory under TEXMF tree, and add the following line to psfonts.map.
                 rml Ryumin-Light-H

CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT
       With  -t  option, you can give makejvf a custom settings for generating
       VF. The syntax is:

                 % comment line
                 MOVE <code>    <right>   <down>

                 REPLACE   <code>    <new code>
                 CHARSET   <code>,<code>,<code>..<code>,<code>,
                 +    <code>,<code>..<code>

       Each line should begin with a command,  and  should  be  TAB-separated.
       Line starting with % is a comment, and empty lines are ignored.

       The MOVE command specifies horizontal/vertical shift amount for the in-
       dividual character <code>. The REPLACE command replaces  the  character
       <code>  with  <new code>. The CHARSET command sets the custom character
       set of output VF; the + character continues from the previous line.

       An example usage can be found in uptex-fonts project. See GitHub repos-
       itory
