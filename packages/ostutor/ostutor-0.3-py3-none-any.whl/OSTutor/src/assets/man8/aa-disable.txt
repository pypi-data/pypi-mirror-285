NAME
       aa-disable - disable an AppArmor security profile

SYNOPSIS
       aa-disable <executable> [<executable> ...] [-d /path/to/profiles]
       [--no-reload] [-r]

OPTIONS
       -d --dir  /path/to/profiles

          Specifies where to look for the AppArmor security profile set.
          Defaults to /etc/apparmor.d.

       --no-reload
          Do not unreload the profile after modifying it.

DESCRIPTION
       aa-disable is used to disable one or more profiles.  This command will
       unload the profile from the kernel and prevent the profile from being
       loaded on AppArmor startup.  The aa-enforce and aa-complain utilities
       may be used to to change this behavior.
