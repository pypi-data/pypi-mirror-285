NAME
       idmap_rfc2307 - Samba's idmap_rfc2307 Backend for Winbind

DESCRIPTION
       The idmap_rfc2307 plugin provides a way for winbind to read id mappings
       from records in an LDAP server as defined in RFC 2307. The LDAP server
       can be stand-alone or the LDAP server provided by the AD server. An AD
       server is always required to provide the mapping between name and SID,
       and the LDAP server is queried for the mapping between name and
       uid/gid. This module implements only the "idmap" API, and is READONLY.

       Mappings must be provided in advance by the administrator by creating
       the user accounts in the Active Directory server and the posixAccount
       and posixGroup objects in the LDAP server. The names in the Active
       Directory server and in the LDAP server have to be the same.

       This id mapping approach allows the reuse of existing LDAP
       authentication servers that store records in the RFC 2307 format.

       When connecting to the LDAP server provided by an AD server, the
       parameter ldap ssl ads determines whether SSL should be used. When
       using a stand-alone LDAP server, ldap ssl applies.

IDMAP OPTIONS
       range = low - high
           Defines the available matching UID and GID range for which the
           backend is authoritative. Note that the range acts as a filter. If
           specified any UID or GID stored in AD that fall outside the range
           is ignored and the corresponding map is discarded. It is intended
           as a way to avoid accidental UID/GID overlaps between local and
           remotely defined IDs.

       ldap_server = <ad | stand-alone >
           Defines the type of LDAP server to use. This can either be the LDAP
           server provided by the Active Directory server (ad) or a
           stand-alone LDAP server.

       bind_path_user
           Specifies the search base where user objects can be found in the
           LDAP server.

       bind_path_group
           Specifies the search base where group objects can be found in the
           LDAP server.

       user_cn = <yes | no>
           Query cn attribute instead of uid attribute for the user name in
           LDAP. This option is not required, the default is no.

       realm
           Append @realm to cn for groups (and users if user_cn is set) in
           LDAP queries. This option is not required, the default is not to
           append the realm.

       ldap_domain
           When using the LDAP server in the Active Directory server, this
           allows one to specify the domain where to access the Active
           Directory server. This allows using trust relationships while
           keeping all RFC 2307 records in one place. This parameter is
           optional, the default is to access the AD server in the current
           domain to query LDAP records.

       ldap_url
           When using a stand-alone LDAP server, this parameter specifies the
           ldap URL for accessing the LDAP server.

       ldap_user_dn
           Defines the user DN to be used for authentication. The secret for
           authenticating this user should be stored with net idmap secret
           (see net(8)). If absent, an anonymous bind will be performed.

EXAMPLES
       The following example shows how to retrieve id mappings from a
       stand-alone LDAP server. This example also shows how to leave a small
       non conflicting range for local id allocation that may be used in
       internal backends like BUILTIN.
