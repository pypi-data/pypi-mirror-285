NAME
       pam_keyinit - Kernel session keyring initialiser module

SYNOPSIS
       pam_keyinit.so [debug] [force] [revoke]

DESCRIPTION
       The pam_keyinit PAM module ensures that the invoking process has a
       session keyring other than the user default session keyring.

       The session component of the module checks to see if the process's
       session keyring is the user default, and, if it is, creates a new
       anonymous session keyring with which to replace it.

       If a new session keyring is created, it will install a link to the user
       common keyring in the session keyring so that keys common to the user
       will be automatically accessible through it.

       The session keyring of the invoking process will thenceforth be
       inherited by all its children unless they override it.

       This module is intended primarily for use by login processes. Be aware
       that after the session keyring has been replaced, the old session
       keyring and the keys it contains will no longer be accessible.

       This module should not, generally, be invoked by programs like su,
       since it is usually desirable for the key set to percolate through to
       the alternate context. The keys have their own permissions system to
       manage this.

       This module should be included as early as possible in a PAM
       configuration, so that other PAM modules can attach tokens to the
       keyring.

       The keyutils package is used to manipulate keys more directly. This can
       be obtained from:

       Keyutils[1]

OPTIONS
       debug
           Log debug information with syslog(3).

       force
           Causes the session keyring of the invoking process to be replaced
           unconditionally.

       revoke
           Causes the session keyring of the invoking process to be revoked
           when the invoking process exits if the session keyring was created
           for this process in the first place.

MODULE TYPES PROVIDED
       Only the session module type is provided.

RETURN VALUES
       PAM_SUCCESS
           This module will usually return this value

       PAM_AUTH_ERR
           Authentication failure.

       PAM_BUF_ERR
           Memory buffer error.

       PAM_IGNORE
           The return value should be ignored by PAM dispatch.

       PAM_SERVICE_ERR
           Cannot determine the user name.

       PAM_SESSION_ERR
           This module will return this value if its arguments are invalid or
           if a system error such as ENOMEM occurs.

       PAM_USER_UNKNOWN
           User not known.

EXAMPLES
       Add this line to your login entries to start each login session with
       its own session keyring:

           session  required  pam_keyinit.so

       This will prevent keys from one session leaking into another session
       for the same user.
