NAME
       systemd-networkd-wait-online.service, systemd-networkd-wait-online -
       Wait for network to come online

SYNOPSIS
       systemd-networkd-wait-online.service

       /lib/systemd/systemd-networkd-wait-online

DESCRIPTION
       systemd-networkd-wait-online is a oneshot system service (see
       systemd.service(5)), that waits for the network to be configured. By
       default, it will wait for all links it is aware of and which are
       managed by systemd-networkd.service(8) to be fully configured or
       failed, and for at least one link to be online. Here, online means that
       the link's operational state is equal or higher than "degraded". The
       threshold can be configured by --operational-state= option.

OPTIONS
       The following options are understood:

       -i INTERFACE[:MIN_OPERSTATE[:MAX_OPERSTATE]],
       --interface=INTERFACE[:MIN_OPERSTATE[:MAX_OPERSTATE]]
           Network interface to wait for before deciding if the system is
           online. This is useful when a system has several interfaces which
           will be configured, but a particular one is necessary to access
           some network resources. When used, all other interfaces are
           ignored. This option may be used more than once to wait for
           multiple network interfaces. When this option is specified multiple
           times, then systemd-networkd-wait-online waits for all specified
           interfaces to be online. Optionally, required minimum and maximum
           operational states can be specified after a colon ":". Please see
           networkctl(1) for possible operational states. If the operational
           state is not specified here, then the value from RequiredForOnline=
           in the corresponding .network file is used if present, and
           "degraded" otherwise.

       --ignore=INTERFACE
           Network interfaces to be ignored when deciding if the system is
           online. By default, only the loopback interface is ignored. This
           option may be used more than once to ignore multiple network
           interfaces.

       -o MIN_OPERSTATE[:MAX_OPERSTATE],
       --operational-state=MIN_OPERSTATE[:MAX_OPERSTATE]
           Takes a minimum operational state and an optional maximum
           operational state. Please see networkctl(1) for possible
           operational states. If set, the specified value overrides
           RequiredForOnline= settings in .network files. But this does not
           override operational states specified in --interface= option.

       --any
           Even if several interfaces are in configuring state,
           systemd-networkd-wait-online exits with success when at least one
           interface becomes online. When this option is specified with
           --interface=, then systemd-networkd-wait-online waits for one of
           the specified interfaces to be online. This option is useful when
           some interfaces may not have carrier on boot.

       --timeout=SECS
           Fail the service if the network is not online by the time the
           timeout elapses. A timeout of 0 disables the timeout. Defaults to
           120 seconds.

       -q, --quiet
           Suppress log messages.

       -h, --help
           Print a short help text and exit.

       --version
           Print a short version string and exit.
