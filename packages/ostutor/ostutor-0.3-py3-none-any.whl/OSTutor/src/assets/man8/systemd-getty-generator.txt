NAME
       systemd-getty-generator - Generator for enabling getty instances on the
       console

SYNOPSIS
       /lib/systemd/system-generators/systemd-getty-generator

DESCRIPTION
       systemd-getty-generator is a generator that automatically instantiates
       serial-getty@.service on the kernel console(s), if they can function as
       ttys and are not provided by the virtual console subsystem. It will
       also instantiate serial-getty@.service instances for virtualizer
       consoles, if execution in a virtualized environment is detected. If
       execution in a container environment is detected, it will instead
       enable console-getty.service for /dev/console, and
       container-getty@.service instances for additional container pseudo TTYs
       as requested by the container manager (see Container Interface[1]).
       This should ensure that the user is shown a login prompt at the right
       place, regardless of which environment the system is started in. For
       example, it is sufficient to redirect the kernel console with a kernel
       command line argument such as console= to get both kernel messages and
       a getty prompt on a serial TTY. See kernel-parameters.txt[2] for more
       information on the console= kernel parameter.

       systemd-getty-generator implements systemd.generator(7).

       Further information about configuration of gettys can be found in
       systemd for Administrators, Part XVI: Gettys on Serial Consoles (and
       Elsewhere)[3].
