       intro - introduction to administration and privileged commands

DESCRIPTION
       Section  8  of the manual describes commands which either can be or are
       used only by the superuser, like system-administration  commands,  dae-
       mons, and hardware-related commands.

       As  with the commands described in Section 1, the commands described in
       this section terminate with an exit status that indicates  whether  the
