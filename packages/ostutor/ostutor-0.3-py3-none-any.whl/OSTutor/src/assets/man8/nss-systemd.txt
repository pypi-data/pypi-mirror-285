NAME
       nss-systemd, libnss_systemd.so.2 - Provide UNIX user and group name
       resolution for user/group lookup via Varlink

SYNOPSIS
       libnss_systemd.so.2

DESCRIPTION
       nss-systemd is a plug-in module for the GNU Name Service Switch (NSS)
       functionality of the GNU C Library (glibc), providing UNIX user and
       group name resolution for services implementing the User/Group Record
       Lookup API via Varlink[1], such as the system and service manager
       systemd(1) (for its DynamicUser= feature, see systemd.exec(5) for
       details) or systemd-homed.service(8).

       This module also ensures that the root and nobody users and groups
       (i.e. the users/groups with the UIDs/GIDs 0 and 65534) remain
       resolvable at all times, even if they aren't listed in /etc/passwd or
       /etc/group, or if these files are missing.

       This module preferably utilizes systemd-userdbd.service(8) for
       resolving users and groups, but also works without the service running.

       To activate the NSS module, add "systemd" to the lines starting with
       "passwd:" and "group:" in /etc/nsswitch.conf.

       It is recommended to place "systemd" after the "files" or "compat"
       entry of the /etc/nsswitch.conf lines so that /etc/passwd and
       /etc/group based mappings take precedence.

EXAMPLE
       Here is an example /etc/nsswitch.conf file that enables nss-systemd
       correctly:

           passwd:         compat mymachines systemd
           group:          compat [SUCCESS=merge] mymachines [SUCCESS=merge] systemd
           shadow:         compat

           hosts:          files mymachines resolve [!UNAVAIL=return] dns myhostname
           networks:       files

           protocols:      db files
           services:       db files
           ethers:         db files
           rpc:            db files

           netgroup:       nis
