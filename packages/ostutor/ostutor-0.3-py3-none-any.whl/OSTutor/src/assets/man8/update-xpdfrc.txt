NAME
       update-xpdfrc - program to generate xpdf's configuration file

SYNOPSIS
       update-xdfrc

DESCRIPTION
       update-xpdfrc  is a program used to generate part of the xpdfrc(5) file
       used by xpdf. The generated configuration file contains a list  of  the
       configuration snippets provided by the xpdf-* language packages.

       You  may  edit the file /etc/xpdfrc to configure xpdf.  However, do not
       edit the generated file /etc/xpdf/includes.  It is updated  whenever  a
       language  package  is  added  or  removed.   You  must include the file
       /etc/xpdf/includes in your xpdfrc to make use of this functionality.

       The language support packages (xpdf-japanese  etc)  provide  additional
       configuration  files  such  as /etc/xpdf/xpdfrc-japanese, which will be
       listed in the generated /etc/xpdf/includes.

FILES
       /etc/xpdf/xpdfrc    main configuration file
       /etc/xpdf/xpdf-*    additional configuration files

SEE ALSO
       xpdfrc(5), xpdf(1).
