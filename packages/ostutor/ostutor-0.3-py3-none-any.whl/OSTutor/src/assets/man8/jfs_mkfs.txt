NAME
       jfs_mkfs - create a JFS formatted partition

SYNOPSIS
       jfs_mkfs [options] device [ blocks ]

DESCRIPTION
       jfs_mkfs  is used to create (format) a JFS partition.  jfs_mkfs must be
       run as root.

       device is the special file name  corresponding  to  the  actual  device
       (e.g.  /dev/hdb1) on which a JFS file system and/or JFS journal will be
       created.  blocks is the number of blocks to be used for the  file  sys-
       tem.  If omitted, jfs_mkfs automatically figures the file system size.

       The default block size is 4096.

WARNING
       jfs_mkfs will destroy all data on the specified device!

OPTIONS
       -c     Check the device for bad blocks before building the file system.

       -j journal_device
              Create  the  external JFS journal on journal_device , create the
              JFS file system on device , and attach the external  journal  to
              the file system.

       -J journal-options
              Create  the  JFS journal on its own device or attach an external
              JFS journal to the JFS file system using  options  specified  on
              the command-line.  The following journal options are supported:

                   journal_dev
                          Create an external JFS journal on the given device.

                   device=external-journal
                          Attach  an  existing external JFS journal located on
                          external-journal to the JFS file system that will be
                          created  on  device.   The external journal must al-
                          ready have been created using the command

                          jfs_mkfs -J journal_dev external-journal

                          Attach the external journal to the file system being
                          created by using the command

                          jfs_mkfs -J device=external-journal device

                          Instead of specifying a device name directly, exter-
                          nal-journal can also  be  specified  by  either  LA-
                          BEL=label  or UUID=UUID to locate the external jour-
                          nal by either the volume label or UUID stored in the
                          JFS  external  log  superblock  at  the start of the
                          journal.  Use jfs_tune(8) to display a  journal  de-
                          vice's  volume label and UUID.  (See the -l, -L, and
                          -U options of jfs_tune(8).)

              Only one of the journal_dev or device= options can be given  per
              jfs_mkfs issuance.

       -L volume_label
              Set the volume label for the newly formatted device.

              If  -L  volume_label  is  used along with -J journal_device, the
              volume label of the specified external journal  device  will  be
              set  to  volume_label.   Otherwise,  the volume label of the JFS
              file system will be set to volume_label.

       -O     Provide case-insensitive support for compatibility with OS/2.

       -q     Quiet execution - do not ask for  confirmation  before  creating
              the file system.

       -s log_size
              Set  the  log  size (in megabytes) of the inline log.  If the -s
              option is not used, the default log size is 0.4% of  the  aggre-
              gate size.

       -V     Print version information and exit (regardless of any other cho-
              sen options).

EXAMPLES
       Format 3rd partition on 2nd hard disk with the volume label "JFS_hdb3":

              jfs_mkfs -L JFS_hdb3 /dev/hdb3

       Format 5th partition on 1st hard disk, verifying each block created:

              jfs_mkfs -c /dev/hda5

       Format 3rd partition on 2nd hard disk as external journal,  format  4th
       partition  on 1st hard disk as JFS file system, and attach the external
       journal to the file system:

              jfs_mkfs -j /dev/hdb3 /dev/hda4
