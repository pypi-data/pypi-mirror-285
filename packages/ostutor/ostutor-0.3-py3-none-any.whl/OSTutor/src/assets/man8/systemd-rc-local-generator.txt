NAME
       systemd-rc-local-generator - Compatibility generator for starting
       /etc/rc.local during boot

SYNOPSIS
       /lib/systemd/system-generators/systemd-rc-local-generator

DESCRIPTION
       systemd-rc-local-generator is a generator that checks whether
       /etc/rc.local exists and is executable, and if it is pulls the
       rc-local.service unit into the boot process. This unit is responsible
       for running this script during late boot. Note that the script will be
       run with slightly different semantics than the original System V
       version, which was run "last" in the boot process, which is a concept
       that does not translate to systemd. The script is run after
       network.target, but in parallel with most other regular system
       services.

       Support for /etc/rc.local is provided for compatibility with specific
       System V systems only. However, it is strongly recommended to avoid
       making use of this script today, and instead provide proper unit files
       with appropriate dependencies for any scripts to run during the boot
       process.

       systemd-rc-local-generator implements systemd.generator(7).
