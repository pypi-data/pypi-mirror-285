NAME
       systemd-bless-boot.service, systemd-bless-boot - Mark current boot
       process as successful

SYNOPSIS
       systemd-bless-boot.service

       /lib/systemd/system-bless-boot

DESCRIPTION
       systemd-bless-boot.service is a system service that marks the current
       boot process as successful. It's automatically pulled into the initial
       transaction when systemd-bless-boot-generator(8) detects that systemd-
       boot(7) style boot counting is used.

       Internally, the service operates based on the LoaderBootCountPath EFI
       variable (of the vendor UUID 4a67b082-0a4c-41cf-b6c7-440b29bb8c4),
       which is passed from the boot loader to the OS. It contains a file
       system path (relative to the EFI system partition) of the Boot Loader
       Specification[1] compliant boot loader entry file or unified kernel
       image file that was used to boot up the system.
       systemd-bless-boot.service removes the two 'tries done' and 'tries
       left' numeric boot counters from the filename, which indicates to
       future invocations of the boot loader that the entry has completed
       booting successfully at least once. (This service will hence rename the
       boot loader entry file or unified kernel image file on the first
       successful boot.)

OPTIONS
       The /lib/systemd/system-bless-boot executable may also be invoked from
       the command line, taking one of the following command arguments:

       status
           The current status of the boot loader entry file or unified kernel
           image file is shown. This outputs one of "good", "bad",
           "indeterminate", "clean", depending on the state and previous
           invocations of the command. The string "indeterminate" is shown
           initially after boot, before it has been marked as "good" or "bad".
           The string "good" is shown after the boot was marked as "good" with
           the good command below, and "bad" conversely after the bad command
           was invoked. The string "clean" is returned when boot counting is
           currently not in effect.

           This command is implied if no command argument is specified.

       good
           When invoked, the current boot loader entry file or unified kernel
           image file will be marked as "good", executing the file rename
           operation described above. This command is intended to be invoked
           at the end of a successful boot. The systemd-bless-boot.service
           unit invokes this command.

       bad
           When called the 'tries left' counter in the boot loader entry file
           name or unified kernel image file name is set to zero, marking the
           boot loader entry or kernel image as "bad", so that the boot loader
           won't consider it anymore on future boots (at least as long as
           there are other entries available that are not marked "bad" yet).
           This command is normally not executed, but can be used to instantly
           put an end to the boot counting logic if a problem is detected and
           persistently mark the boot entry as bad.

       indeterminate
           This command undoes any marking of the current boot loader entry
           file or unified kernel image file as good or bad. This is
           implemented by renaming the boot loader entry file or unified
           kernel image file back to the path encoded in the
           LoaderBootCountPath EFI variable.

       -h, --help
           Print a short help text and exit.

       --version
           Print a short version string and exit.
