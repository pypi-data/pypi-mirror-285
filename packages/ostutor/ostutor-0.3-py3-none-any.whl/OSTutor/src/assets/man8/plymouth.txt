NAME
       plymouth - A graphical boot system and logger

DESCRIPTION
       plymouth is a graphical boot system for Linux which takes advantage of
       the kernel-based mode setting (KMS) available for modern graphic cards
       to provide a seamless, flickerfree and attractive boot screen. It
       allows to choose between various, static or animated graphical themes
       to spruce up the startup and avoid the noise generated by the vast
       amount of kernel messages while the machine boots into X. On systems
       where kernel-based mode setting is not available, plymouth falls back
       to a text mode boot screen which provides a simple progress bar to pro-
       vide feedback during boot.

       In order for the configured default plymouth theme to be loaded during
       boot, the option `splash' (or `rhgb' for backward compatibility with
       the RHGB boot splash) must be provided at the kernel command line.
       Without this command line option, plymouth will default to showing
       detailed boot output.

       During the boot process, the user can switch between the graphical
       theme and the detailed boot output using the Escape key.
