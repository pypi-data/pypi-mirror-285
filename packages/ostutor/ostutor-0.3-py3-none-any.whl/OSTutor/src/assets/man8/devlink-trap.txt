DESCRIPTION
   devlink trap show - display available packet traps and their attributes
       DEV - specifies the devlink device from which to show packet traps.  If
       this argument is omitted all packet traps of all devices are listed.

       trap TRAP - specifies the packet trap.  Only applicable if a devlink
       device is also specified.

   devlink trap set - set attributes of a packet trap
       DEV - specifies the devlink device the packet trap belongs to.

       trap TRAP - specifies the packet trap.

       action { trap | drop }
              packet trap action.

              trap - the sole copy of the packet is sent to the CPU.

              drop - the packet is dropped by the underlying device and a copy
              is not sent to the CPU.

   devlink trap group show - display available packet trap groups and their
       attributes
       DEV - specifies the devlink device from which to show packet trap
       groups.  If this argument is omitted all packet trap groups of all de-
       vices are listed.

       group GROUP - specifies the packet trap group.  Only applicable if a
       devlink device is also specified.

   devlink trap group set - set attributes of a packet trap group
       DEV - specifies the devlink device the packet trap group belongs to.

       group GROUP - specifies the packet trap group.

       action { trap | drop }
              packet trap action. The action is set for all the packet traps
              member in the trap group. The actions of non-drop traps cannot
              be changed and are thus skipped.
