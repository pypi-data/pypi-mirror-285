NAME
       request-key  - handle key instantiation callback requests from the ker-
       nel

SYNOPSIS
       /sbin/request-key <op> <key>  <uid>  <gid>  <threadring>  <processring>
            <sessionring> [<info>]

DESCRIPTION
       This  program  is  invoked by the kernel when the kernel is asked for a
       key that it doesn't have immediately available. The  kernel  creates  a
       partially  set up key and then calls out to this program to instantiate
       it. It is not intended to be called directly.

       However, for debugging purposes, it can be given some  options  on  the
       command line:

       -d     Turn  on  debugging mode.  In this mode, no attempts are made to
              access any keys and, if a handler program is selected, it  won't
              be executed; instead, this program will print a message and exit
              0.

       -D <description>
              In debugging mode, use the proposed  key  description  specified
              with  this rather than the sample ("user;0;0;1f0000;debug:1234")
              built into the program.

       -l     Use configuration from the current directory.  The program  will
              use request-key.d/* and request-key.conf from the current direc-
              tory rather than from /etc.

       -n     Don't log to the system log.  Ordinarily, error messages and de-
              bugging  messages  will  be copied to the system log - this will
              prevent that.

       -v     Turn on debugging output.  This may be specified multiple  times
              to produce increasing levels of verbosity.

       --version
              Print the program version and exit.

ERRORS
       All errors will be logged to the syslog.

FILES
       /etc/request-key.d/*.conf Individual configuration files.

       /etc/request-key.conf Fallback configuration file.
