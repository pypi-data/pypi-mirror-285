NAME
       systemd-time-wait-sync.service, systemd-time-wait-sync - Wait Until
       Kernel Time Synchronized

SYNOPSIS
       systemd-time-wait-sync.service

       /lib/systemd/systemd-time-wait-sync

DESCRIPTION
       systemd-time-wait-sync is a system service that delays the start of
       units that depend on time-sync.target until the system time has been
       synchronized with an accurate time source by systemd-timesyncd.service.

       systemd-timesyncd.service notifies on successful synchronization.
       systemd-time-wait-sync also tries to detect when the kernel marks the
       time as synchronized, but this detection is not reliable and is
       intended only as a fallback for other services that can be used to
       synchronize time (e.g., ntpd, chronyd).

FILES
       /run/systemd/timesync/synchronized
           The presence of this file indicates to this service that the system
           clock has been synchronized.
