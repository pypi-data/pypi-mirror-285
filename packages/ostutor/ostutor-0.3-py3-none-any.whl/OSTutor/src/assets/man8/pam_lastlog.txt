NAME
       pam_lastlog - PAM module to display date of last login and perform
       inactive account lock out

SYNOPSIS
       pam_lastlog.so [debug] [silent] [never] [nodate] [nohost] [noterm]
                      [nowtmp] [noupdate] [showfailed] [inactive=<days>]

DESCRIPTION
       pam_lastlog is a PAM module to display a line of information about the
       last login of the user. In addition, the module maintains the
       /var/log/lastlog file.

       Some applications may perform this function themselves. In such cases,
       this module is not necessary.

       If the module is called in the auth or account phase, the accounts that
       were not used recently enough will be disallowed to log in. The check
       is not performed for the root account so the root is never locked out.

OPTIONS
       debug
           Print debug information.

       silent
           Don't inform the user about any previous login, just update the
           /var/log/lastlog file.

       never
           If the /var/log/lastlog file does not contain any old entries for
           the user, indicate that the user has never previously logged in
           with a welcome message.

       nodate
           Don't display the date of the last login.

       noterm
           Don't display the terminal name on which the last login was
           attempted.

       nohost
           Don't indicate from which host the last login was attempted.

       nowtmp
           Don't update the wtmp entry.

       noupdate
           Don't update any file.

       showfailed
           Display number of failed login attempts and the date of the last
           failed attempt from btmp. The date is not displayed when nodate is
           specified.

       inactive=<days>
           This option is specific for the auth or account phase. It specifies
           the number of days after the last login of the user when the user
           will be locked out by the module. The default value is 90.

MODULE TYPES PROVIDED
       The auth and account module type allows to lock out users which did not
       login recently enough. The session module type is provided for
       displaying the information about the last login and/or updating the
       lastlog and wtmp files.

RETURN VALUES
       PAM_SUCCESS
           Everything was successful.

       PAM_SERVICE_ERR
           Internal service module error.

       PAM_USER_UNKNOWN
           User not known.

       PAM_AUTH_ERR
           User locked out in the auth or account phase due to inactivity.

       PAM_IGNORE
           There was an error during reading the lastlog file in the auth or
           account phase and thus inactivity of the user cannot be determined.

EXAMPLES
       Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/login to display the last login
       time of an user:

               session  required  pam_lastlog.so nowtmp

       To reject the user if he did not login during the previous 50 days the
       following line can be used:

               auth  required  pam_lastlog.so inactive=50

FILES
       /var/log/lastlog
           Lastlog logging file
