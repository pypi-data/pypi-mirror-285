NAME
       systemd-logind.service, systemd-logind - Login manager

SYNOPSIS
       systemd-logind.service

       /lib/systemd/systemd-logind

DESCRIPTION
       systemd-logind is a system service that manages user logins. It is
       responsible for:

       o   Keeping track of users and sessions, their processes and their idle
           state. This is implemented by allocating a systemd slice unit for
           each user below user.slice, and a scope unit below it for each
           concurrent session of a user. Also, a per-user service manager is
           started as system service instance of user@.service for each logged
           in user.

       o   Generating and managing session IDs. If auditing is available and
           an audit session ID is already set for a session, then this ID is
           reused as the session ID. Otherwise, an independent session counter
           is used.

       o   Providing polkit[1]-based access for users for operations such as
           system shutdown or sleep

       o   Implementing a shutdown/sleep inhibition logic for applications

       o   Handling of power/sleep hardware keys

       o   Multi-seat management

       o   Session switch management

       o   Device access management for users

       o   Automatic spawning of text logins (gettys) on virtual console
           activation and user runtime directory management

       User sessions are registered with logind via the pam_systemd(8) PAM
       module.

       See logind.conf(5) for information about the configuration of this
       service.

       See sd-login(3) for information about the basic concepts of logind such
       as users, sessions and seats.

       See the logind D-Bus API Documentation[2] for information about the
       APIs systemd-logind provides.

       For more information on the inhibition logic see the Inhibitor Lock
       Developer Documentation[3].
