NAME
       jfs_fsck  -  initiate  replay of the JFS transaction log, and check and
       repair a JFS formatted device

SYNOPSIS
       jfs_fsck [ -afnpvV ] [ -j journal_device ] [ --omit_journal_replay ]  [
       --replay_journal_only ] device

DESCRIPTION
       jfs_fsck is used to replay the JFS transaction log, check a JFS format-
       ted device for errors, and fix any errors found.

       device is the special file name corresponding to the actual  device  to
       be checked (e.g. /dev/hdb1).

       jfs_fsck must be run as root.

WARNING
       jfs_fsck  should  only  be  used to check an unmounted file system or a
       file system that is mounted READ ONLY.  Using jfs_fsck to check a  file
       system  mounted  other  than  READ ONLY could seriously damage the file
       system!

OPTIONS
       If no options are selected, the default is -p.

       -a     Autocheck mode - Replay the transaction log.   Do  not  continue
              fsck  processing  unless the aggregate state is dirty or the log
              replay failed.  Functionally equivalent to -p.   Autocheck  mode
              is  typically  the  default mode used when jfs_fsck is called at
              boot time.

       -f     Replay the transaction log and force checking even if  the  file
              system appears clean.  Repair all problems automatically.

       -j journal_device
              Specify the journal device.

       -n     Open  the  file system read only.  Do not replay the transaction
              log.  Report errors, but do not repair them.

       --omit_journal_replay
              Omit the replay of the transaction log.  This option should  not
              be used unless as a last resort (i.e.  the log has been severely
              corrupted and replaying it causes further problems).

       -p     Automatically repair ("preen")  the  file  system.   Replay  the
              transaction log.  Do not continue fsck processing unless the ag-
              gregate state is dirty or the log replay  failed.   Functionally
              equivalent to -a.

       --replay_journal_only
              Only  replay  the  transaction log.  Do not continue with a full
              file system check if the replay fails or if the file  system  is
              still  dirty  even after a journal replay.  In general, this op-
              tion should only be used for  debugging  purposes  as  it  could
              leave the file system in an unmountable state.  This option can-
              not be used with -f, -n, or --omit_journal_replay.

       -v     Verbose messaging - print details and debug statements  to  std-
              out.

       -V     Print version information and exit (regardless of any other cho-
              sen options).

EXAMPLES
       Check the 3rd partition on the 2nd hard disk, print  extended  informa-
       tion  to  stdout,  replay  the transaction log, force complete jfs_fsck
       checking, and give permission to repair all errors:

              jfs_fsck -v -f /dev/hdb3

       Check the 5th partition on the 1st hard disk, and report,  but  do  not
       repair, any errors:

              jfs_fsck -n /dev/hda5

EXIT CODE
       The exit code returned by jfs_fsck represents one of the following con-
       ditions:

        0     No errors

        1     File system errors corrected  and/or  transaction  log  replayed
              successfully

        2     File  system errors corrected, system should be rebooted if file
              system was mounted

        4     File system errors left uncorrected

        8     Operational error

        16    Usage or syntax error

        128   Shared library error
