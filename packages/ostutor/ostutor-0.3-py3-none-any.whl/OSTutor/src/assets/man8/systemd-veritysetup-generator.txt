NAME
       systemd-veritysetup-generator - Unit generator for integrity protected
       block devices

SYNOPSIS
       /lib/systemd/system-generators/systemd-veritysetup-generator

DESCRIPTION
       systemd-veritysetup-generator is a generator that translates kernel
       command line options configuring integrity-protected block devices
       (verity) into native systemd units early at boot and when configuration
       of the system manager is reloaded. This will create systemd-
       veritysetup@.service(8) units as necessary.

       Currently, only a single verity device may be set up with this
       generator, backing the root file system of the OS.

       systemd-veritysetup-generator implements systemd.generator(7).

KERNEL COMMAND LINE
       systemd-veritysetup-generator understands the following kernel command
       line parameters:

       systemd.verity=, rd.systemd.verity=
           Takes a boolean argument. Defaults to "yes". If "no", disables the
           generator entirely.  rd.systemd.verity= is honored only by the
           initial RAM disk (initrd) while systemd.verity= is honored by both
           the host system and the initrd.

       roothash=
           Takes a root hash value for the root file system. Expects a hash
           value formatted in hexadecimal characters of the appropriate length
           (i.e. most likely 256 bit/64 characters, or longer). If not
           specified via systemd.verity_root_data= and
           systemd.verity_root_hash=, the hash and data devices to use are
           automatically derived from the specified hash value. Specifically,
           the data partition device is looked for under a GPT partition UUID
           derived from the first 128bit of the root hash, the hash partition
           device is looked for under a GPT partition UUID derived from the
           last 128bit of the root hash. Hence it is usually sufficient to
           specify the root hash to boot from an integrity protected root file
           system, as device paths are automatically determined from it -- as
           long as the partition table is properly set up.

       systemd.verity_root_data=, systemd.verity_root_hash=
           These two settings take block device paths as arguments and may be
           used to explicitly configure the data partition and hash partition
           to use for setting up the integrity protection for the root file
           system. If not specified, these paths are automatically derived
           from the roothash= argument (see above).
