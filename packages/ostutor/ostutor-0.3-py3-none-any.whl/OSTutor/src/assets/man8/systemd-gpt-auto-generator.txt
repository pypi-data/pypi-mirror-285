NAME
       systemd-gpt-auto-generator - Generator for automatically discovering
       and mounting root, /home/, /srv/, /var/ and /var/tmp/ partitions, as
       well as discovering and enabling swap partitions, based on GPT
       partition type GUIDs.

SYNOPSIS
       /lib/systemd/system-generators/systemd-gpt-auto-generator

DESCRIPTION
       systemd-gpt-auto-generator is a unit generator that automatically
       discovers root, /home/, /srv/, /var/, /var/tmp/, the EFI System
       Partition, the Extended Boot Loader Partition and swap partitions and
       creates mount and swap units for them, based on the partition type
       GUIDs of GUID partition tables (GPT), see UEFI Specification[1],
       chapter 5. It implements the Discoverable Partitions Specification[2].
       Note that this generator has no effect on non-GPT systems, and on
       specific mount points that are directories already containing files.
       Also, on systems where the units are explicitly configured (for
       example, listed in fstab(5)), the units this generator creates are
       overridden, but additional implicit dependencies might be created.

       This generator will only look for the root partition on the same
       physical disk the EFI System Partition (ESP) is located on. Note that
       support from the boot loader is required: the EFI variable
       LoaderDevicePartUUID of the 4a67b082-0a4c-41cf-b6c7-440b29bb8c4f vendor
       UUID is used to determine from which partition, and hence the disk from
       which the system was booted. If the boot loader does not set this
       variable, this generator will not be able to autodetect the root
       partition. See the Boot Loader Interface[3] for details.

       Similarly, this generator will only look for the other partitions on
       the same physical disk as the root partition. In this case, boot loader
       support is not required. These partitions will not be searched for on
       systems where the root file system is distributed on multiple disks,
       for example via btrfs RAID.

       systemd-gpt-auto-generator is useful for centralizing file system
       configuration in the partition table and making configuration in
       /etc/fstab or on the kernel command line unnecessary.

       This generator looks for the partitions based on their partition type
       GUID. The following partition type GUIDs are identified:

       The /home/, /srv/, /var/ and /var/tmp/ partitions may be encrypted in
       LUKS format. In this case, a device mapper device is set up under the
       names /dev/mapper/home, /dev/mapper/srv, /dev/mapper/var and
       /dev/mapper/tmp. Note that this might create conflicts if the same
       partition is listed in /etc/crypttab with a different device mapper
       device name.

       When systemd is running in the initrd the / partition may be encrypted
       in LUKS format as well. In this case, a device mapper device is set up
       under the name /dev/mapper/root, and a sysroot.mount is set up that
       mounts the device under /sysroot. For more information, see bootup(7).

       Mount and automount units for the EFI System Partition (ESP) are
       generated on EFI systems. The ESP is mounted to /boot/ (except if an
       Extended Boot Loader partition exists, see below), unless a mount point
       directory /efi/ exists, in which case it is mounted there. Since this
       generator creates an automount unit, the mount will only be activated
       on-demand, when accessed. On systems where /boot/ (or /efi/ if it
       exists) is an explicitly configured mount (for example, listed in
       fstab(5)) or where the /boot/ (or /efi/) mount point is non-empty, no
       mount units are generated.

       If the disk contains an Extended Boot Loader partition, as defined in
       the Boot Loader Specification[4], it is made available at /boot/ (by
       means of an automount point, similar to the ESP, see above). If both an
       EFI System Partition and an Extended Boot Loader partition exist the
       latter is preferably mounted to /boot/. Make sure to create both /efi/
       and /boot/ to ensure both partitions are mounted.

       When using this generator in conjunction with btrfs file systems, make
       sure to set the correct default subvolumes on them, using btrfs
       subvolume set-default.

       systemd-gpt-auto-generator implements systemd.generator(7).

KERNEL COMMAND LINE
       systemd-gpt-auto-generator understands the following kernel command
       line parameters:

       systemd.gpt_auto, rd.systemd.gpt_auto
           Those options take an optional boolean argument, and default to
           yes. The generator is enabled by default, and a negative value may
           be used to disable it.

       root=
           When used with the special value "gpt-auto", automatic discovery of
           the root partition based on the GPT partition type is enabled. Any
           other value disables this generator.

       rw, ro
           Mount the root partition read-write or read-only initially.

           Note that unlike most kernel command line options these settings do
           not override configuration in the file system, and the file system
           may be remounted later. See systemd-remount-fs.service(8).
