NAME
       systemd-backlight@.service, systemd-backlight - Load and save the
       display backlight brightness at boot and shutdown

SYNOPSIS
       systemd-backlight@.service

       /lib/systemd/systemd-backlight

DESCRIPTION
       systemd-backlight@.service is a service that restores the display
       backlight brightness at early boot and saves it at shutdown. On disk,
       the backlight brightness is stored in /var/lib/systemd/backlight/.
       During loading, if the udev property ID_BACKLIGHT_CLAMP is not set to
       false, the brightness is clamped to a value of at least 1 or 5% of
       maximum brightness, whichever is greater. This restriction will be
       removed when the kernel allows user space to reliably set a brightness
       value which does not turn off the display.

KERNEL COMMAND LINE
       systemd-backlight understands the following kernel command line
       parameter:

       systemd.restore_state=
           Takes a boolean argument. Defaults to "1". If "0", does not restore
           the backlight settings on boot. However, settings will still be
           stored on shutdown.
