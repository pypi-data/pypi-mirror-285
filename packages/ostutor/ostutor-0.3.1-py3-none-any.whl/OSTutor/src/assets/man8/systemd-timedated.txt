NAME
       systemd-timedated.service, systemd-timedated - Time and date bus
       mechanism

SYNOPSIS
       systemd-timedated.service

       /lib/systemd/systemd-timedated

DESCRIPTION
       systemd-timedated is a system service that may be used as a mechanism
       to change the system clock and timezone, as well as to enable/disable
       network time synchronization.  systemd-timedated is automatically
       activated on request and terminates itself when it is unused.

       The tool timedatectl(1) is a command line client to this service.

       See the developer documentation[1] for information about the APIs
       systemd-timedated provides.

LIST OF NETWORK TIME SYNCHRONIZATION SERVICES
       systemd-timesyncd will look for files with a ".list" extension in
       ntp-units.d/ directories. Each file is parsed as a list of unit names,
       one per line. Empty lines and lines with comments ("#") are ignored.
       Files are read from /usr/lib/systemd/ntp-units.d/ and the corresponding
       directories under /etc/, /run/, /usr/local/lib/. Files in /etc/
       override files with the same name in /run/, /usr/local/lib/, and /lib/.
       Files in /run/ override files with the same name under /usr/. Packages
       should install their configuration files in /usr/lib/ (distribution
       packages) or /usr/local/lib/ (local installs).

       Example 1. ntp-units.d/ entry for systemd-timesyncd

           # /usr/lib/systemd/ntp-units.d/80-systemd-timesync.list
           systemd-timesyncd.service

       If the environment variable $SYSTEMD_TIMEDATED_NTP_SERVICES is set,
       systemd-timesyncd will parse the contents of that variable as a
       colon-separated list of unit names. When set, this variable overrides
       the file-based list described above.

       Example 2. An override that specifies that chronyd should be used if
       available

           SYSTEMD_TIMEDATED_NTP_SERVICES=chronyd.service:systemd-timesyncd.service
