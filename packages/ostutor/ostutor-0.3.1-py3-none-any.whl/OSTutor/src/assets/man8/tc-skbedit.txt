NAME
       skbedit - SKB editing action

SYNOPSIS
       tc ... action skbedit [ queue_mapping QUEUE_MAPPING ] [ priority PRIOR-
               ITY ] [ mark MARK[/MASK] ] [ ptype PTYPE ] [ inheritdsfield ]

DESCRIPTION
       The skbedit action allows to change a packet's associated meta data. It
       complements  the  pedit action, which in turn allows to change parts of
       the packet data itself.

       The most unique feature of skbedit is its ability to decide over  which
       queue of an interface with multiple transmit queues the packet is to be
       sent out. The number of available transmit queues is reflected by sysfs
       entries  within /sys/class/net/<interface>/queues with name tx-N (where
       N is the actual queue number).

OPTIONS
       queue_mapping QUEUE_MAPPING
              Override the packet's transmit queue.  Useful  when  applied  to
              packets   transmitted   over   MQ-capable   network  interfaces.
              QUEUE_MAPPING is an unsigned 16bit value in decimal format.

       priority PRIORITY
              Override the packet classification decision.  PRIORITY is either
              root,  none  or a hexadecimal major class ID optionally followed
              by a colon (:) and a hexadecimal minor class ID.

       mark MARK[/MASK]
              Change the packet's firewall mark value.  MARK  is  an  unsigned
              32bit  value in automatically detected format (i.e., prefix with
              '0x' for hexadecimal interpretation, etc.).   MASK  defines  the
              32-bit mask selecting bits of mark value. Default is 0xffffffff.

       ptype PTYPE
              Override  the  packet's  type. Useful for setting packet type to
              host when needing to allow ingressing packets with the wrong MAC
              address  but  correct IP address.  PTYPE is one of: host, other-
              host, broadcast, multicast

       inheritdsfield
              Override the packet classification decision, and any value spec-
              ified with priority, using the information stored in the Differ-
              entiated Services Field of the IPv6/IPv4 header (RFC2474).
