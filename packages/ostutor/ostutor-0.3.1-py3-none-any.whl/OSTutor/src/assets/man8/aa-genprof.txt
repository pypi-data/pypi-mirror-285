NAME
       aa-genprof - profile generation utility for AppArmor

SYNOPSIS
       aa-genprof <executable> [-d /path/to/profiles] [-f /path/to/logfile]

OPTIONS
       -d --dir  /path/to/profiles

          Specifies where to look for the AppArmor security profile set.
          Defaults to /etc/apparmor.d.

       -f --file  /path/to/logfile

               Specifies the location of logfile.
               Default locations are read from F</etc/apparmor/logprof.conf>.
               Typical defaults are:
                        /var/log/audit/audit.log
                        /var/log/syslog
                        /var/log/messages

DESCRIPTION
       When running aa-genprof, you must specify a program to profile.  If the
       specified program is not a fully-qualified path, aa-genprof will search
       $PATH in order to find the program.

       If a profile does not exist for the program, aa-genprof will create one
       using aa-autodep(1).

       Genprof will then:

          - set the profile to complain mode

          - write a mark to the system log

          - instruct the user to start the application to
            be profiled in another window and exercise its functionality

       It then presents the user with two options, (S)can system log for
       entries to add to profile and (F)inish.

       If the user selects (S)can or hits return, aa-genprof will parse the
       complain mode logs and iterate through generated violations using
       aa-logprof(1).

       After the user finishes selecting profile entries based on violations
       that were detected during the program execution, aa-genprof will reload
       the updated profiles in complain mode and again prompt the user for
       (S)can and (F)inish. This cycle can then be repeated as necessary until
       all application functionality has been exercised without generating
       access violations.

       When the user eventually hits (F)inish, aa-genprof will set the main
       profile, and any other profiles that were generated, into enforce mode
       and exit.
