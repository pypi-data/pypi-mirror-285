NAME
       update-motd  - immediately update the dynamic MOTD and print it to std-
       out

SYNOPSIS
       update-motd [--show-only]

DESCRIPTION
       The PAM MOTD module updates  the  Message-of-the-Day  automatically  on
       user logins.

       But sometimes, the system administrator may want to update the MOTD im-
       mediately or on demand.

       This simple program performs the same actions handled by PAM on  login,
       and prints the new MOTD to stdout.

       Note  that  only  the  system  administrator can typically write to the
       MOTD, and thus this utility should be executed as the root user.

       The program also accepts the  --show-only option to  not  update,  just
       show the MOTD. Regular users can use this option to see the dynamically
       generated MOTD even when the root user did not generate it in  advance.
       The   show-motd   package  contains  the  /etc/profile.d/update-motd.sh
       snipped to show MOTD in interactive shells when the PAM MOTD module did
       not show it on login.

       For  best  practices  and  additional  information,  please see update-
       motd(5).
