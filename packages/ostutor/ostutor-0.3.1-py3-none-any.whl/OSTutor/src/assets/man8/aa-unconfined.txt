NAME
       aa-unconfined - output a list of processes with tcp or udp ports that
       do not have AppArmor profiles loaded

SYNOPSIS
       aa-unconfined [--paranoid] [--with-ss | --with-netstat]

OPTIONS
       --paranoid
           Displays all processes from /proc filesystem with tcp or udp ports
           that do not have AppArmor profiles loaded.

       --with-ss
           Use the ss(8) command to find processes listening on network
           sockets (the default).

       --with-netstat
           Use the netstat(8) command to find processes listening on network
           sockets. This is also what aa-unconfined will fall back to when
           ss(8) is not available.

DESCRIPTION
       aa-unconfined will use netstat(8) to determine which processes have
       open network sockets and do not have AppArmor profiles loaded into the
       kernel.

BUGS
       aa-unconfined must be run as root to retrieve the process executable
       link from the /proc filesystem. This program is susceptible to race
       conditions of several flavours: an unlinked executable will be
       mishandled; an executable started before an AppArmor profile is loaded
       will not appear in the output, despite running without confinement; a
       process that dies between the netstat(8) and further checks will be
       mishandled. This program only lists processes using TCP and UDP. In
       short, this program is unsuitable for forensics use and is provided
       only as an aid to profiling all network-accessible processes in the
       lab.
