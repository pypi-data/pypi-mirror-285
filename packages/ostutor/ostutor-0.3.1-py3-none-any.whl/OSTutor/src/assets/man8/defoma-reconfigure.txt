NAME
       defoma-reconfigure - Reconfigure all from zero.

SYNOPSIS
       defoma-reconfigure [-f]

DESCRIPTION
       defoma-reconfigure reconfigures font configuration from zero.  It fixes
       a critical bug of data loss, but also is used  for  reconfiguration  of
       fonts.

       defoma-reconfigure  first  removes  almost all files and symlinks under
       /var/lib/defoma, to clean up all font configuration, and run defoma-app
       with update command. You should backup /var/lib/defoma if you put a im-
       portant file there by yourself.

       -f option is used to fix the data confusion which occurs when defoma is
       aborted.
