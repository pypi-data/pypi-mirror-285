SYNOPSIS
       jfs_fscklog [ -d ] [ -e device ] [ -f output.file ] [ -p ] [ -V ]

DESCRIPTION
       jfs_fscklog with option -e device extracts the contents of  either  the
       most  recent  or  immediately prior (specified with option -p) JFS fsck
       service log from the specified device, and writes the output to a file.
       The  file name may be specified with the -f option, or the default file
       name is <pwd>fscklog.new.  If the -p option is used, the  default  file
       name is <pwd>fscklog.old.

       jfs_fscklog with option -d formats and displays the contents of the ex-
       tracted file.

       jfs_fscklog with options -d and -e device extracts and displays the JFS
       fsck service log.

OPTIONS
       -d     Format and display a previously extracted JFS fsck service log.

       -e device
              Extract  the  JFS fsck service log from device and store it in a
              file.  (device is the special file name corresponding to the ac-
              tual  device  from  which  the  fsck log will be extracted (e.g.
              /dev/hdb1 )).

       -f file.name
              Specify the file name, overriding the default file  name.   When
              used  with  -e  device, file.name specifies the name of the file
              into which the JFS fsck log will be extracted.  When  used  with
              -d,  file.name  specifies  the  name of the extracted file whose
              contents will be formatted and displayed.

              file.name must be 127 characters or less in length.

              file.name will be created in the present working  directory  un-
              less it is fully qualified.

       -p     Extract the prior log (as opposed to the most recent log).

       -V     Print version information and exit (regardless of any other cho-
              sen options).
