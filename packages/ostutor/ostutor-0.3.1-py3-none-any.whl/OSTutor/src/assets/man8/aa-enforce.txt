NAME
       aa-enforce - set an AppArmor security profile to enforce mode from
       being disabled or complain mode.

SYNOPSIS
       aa-enforce <executable> [<executable> ...] [-d /path/to/profiles]
       [--no-reload]

OPTIONS
       -d --dir / path/to/profiles

          Specifies where to look for the AppArmor security profile set.
          Defaults to /etc/apparmor.d.

       --no-reload
          Do not reload the profile after modifying it.

DESCRIPTION
       aa-enforce is used to set one or more profiles to enforce mode.  This
       command is only relevant in conjunction with the aa-complain utility
       which sets a profile to complain mode and the aa-disable utility which
       unloads and disables a profile.  The default mode for a security policy
       is enforce and the aa-complain utility must be run to change this
       behavior.
