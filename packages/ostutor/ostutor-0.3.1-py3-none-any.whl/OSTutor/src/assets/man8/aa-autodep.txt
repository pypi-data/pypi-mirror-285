NAME
       aa-autodep - guess basic AppArmor profile requirements

SYNOPSIS
       aa-autodep <executable> [<executable> ...] [-d /path/to/profiles] [-f]

OPTIONS
       -d --dir  /path/to/profiles

          Specifies where to look for the AppArmor security profile set.
          Defaults to /etc/apparmor.d.

       -f --force

          Overwrites any existing AppArmor profile for the executable with the generated minimal AppArmor profile.

DESCRIPTION
       aa-autodep is used to generate a minimal AppArmor profile for a set of
       executables. This program will generate a profile for binary executable
       as well as interpreted script programs. At a minimum aa-autodep will
       provide a base profile containing a base include directive which
       includes basic profile entries needed by most programs.  The profile is
       generated by recursively calling ldd(1) on the executables listed on
       the command line.

       The --force option will overwrite any existing profile for the
       executable with the newly generated minimal AppArmor profile.

BUGS
       This program does not perform full static analysis of executables, so
       the profiles generated are necessarily incomplete. If you find any
       bugs, please report them at
       <https://bugs.launchpad.net/apparmor/+filebug>.
