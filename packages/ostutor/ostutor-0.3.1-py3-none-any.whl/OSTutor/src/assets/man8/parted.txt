NAME
       parted - a partition manipulation program

SYNOPSIS
       parted [options] [device [command [options...]...]]

DESCRIPTION
       parted  is a program to manipulate disk partitions.  It supports multi-
       ple partition table formats, including MS-DOS and GPT.   It  is  useful
       for  creating space for new operating systems, reorganising disk usage,
       and copying data to new hard disks.

       This manual page documents parted briefly.  Complete  documentation  is
       distributed with the package in GNU Info format.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              displays a help message

       -l, --list
              lists partition layout on all block devices

       -m, --machine
              displays machine parseable output

       -s, --script
              never prompts for user intervention

       -v, --version
              displays the version

       -a alignment-type, --align alignment-type
              Set  alignment  for  newly  created  partitions, valid alignment
              types are:

              none   Use the minimum alignment allowed by the disk type.

              cylinder
                     Align partitions to cylinders.

              minimal
                     Use minimum alignment as given by the disk  topology  in-
                     formation.  This and the opt value will use layout infor-
                     mation provided by the disk to align the  logical  parti-
                     tion  table  addresses  to  actual physical blocks on the
                     disks.  The min value is the minimum alignment needed  to
                     align  the  partition  properly to physical blocks, which
                     avoids performance degradation.

              optimal
                     Use optimum alignment as given by the disk  topology  in-
                     formation.  This  aligns  to  a  multiple of the physical
                     block size in a way that guarantees optimal performance.

COMMANDS
       [device]
              The block device to be used.  When none is  given,  parted  will
              use the first block device it finds.

       [command [options]]
              Specifies  the  command to be executed.  If no command is given,
              parted will present a command prompt.  Possible commands are:

              help [command]
                     Print general help, or help on command if specified.

              align-check type partition
                     Check if partition satisfies the alignment constraint  of
                     type.  type must be "minimal" or "optimal".

              mklabel label-type
                     Create  a  new disklabel (partition table) of label-type.
                     label-type should be one of "aix", "amiga", "bsd", "dvh",
                     "gpt", "loop", "mac", "msdos", "pc98", or "sun".

              mkpart [part-type name fs-type] start end
                     Create  a  new partition. part-type may be specified only
                     with msdos and dvh partition tables, it should be one  of
                     "primary",  "logical",  or  "extended".  name is required
                     for GPT partition tables and fs-type  is  optional.   fs-
                     type  can  be  one  of  "btrfs",  "ext2", "ext3", "ext4",
                     "fat16", "fat32", "hfs",  "hfs+",  "linux-swap",  "ntfs",
                     "reiserfs", "udf", or "xfs".

              name partition name
                     Set the name of partition to name. This option works only
                     on Mac, PC98, and GPT disklabels. The name can be  placed
                     in  double  quotes,  if  necessary.  And depending on the
                     shell may need to also be wrapped  in  single  quotes  so
                     that the shell doesn't strip off the double quotes.

              print  Display the partition table.

              quit   Exit from parted.

              rescue start end
                     Rescue  a  lost  partition that was located somewhere be-
                     tween start and end.  If a  partition  is  found,  parted
                     will  ask  if  you  want to create an entry for it in the
                     partition table.

              resizepart partition end
                     Change the end position of  partition.   Note  that  this
                     does not modify any filesystem present in the partition.

              rm partition
                     Delete partition.

              select device
                     Choose  device  as  the  current  device  to edit. device
                     should usually be a Linux hard disk device, but it can be
                     a partition, software raid device, or an LVM logical vol-
                     ume if necessary.

              set partition flag state
                     Change the state of the flag on partition to state.  Sup-
                     ported  flags  are:  "boot",  "root",  "swap",  "hidden",
                     "raid", "lvm", "lba", "legacy_boot",  "irst",  "msftres",
                     "esp", "chromeos_kernel" and "palo".  state should be ei-
                     ther "on" or "off".

              unit unit
                     Set unit as the unit to use when displaying locations and
                     sizes,  and for interpreting those given by the user when
                     not suffixed with an explicit unit.  unit can be  one  of
                     "s"  (sectors),  "B"  (bytes),  "kB",  "MB", "MiB", "GB",
                     "GiB", "TB", "TiB",  "%"  (percentage  of  device  size),
                     "cyl"  (cylinders), "chs" (cylinders, heads, sectors), or
                     "compact" (megabytes for input, and a human-friendly form
                     for output).

              toggle partition flag
                     Toggle the state of flag on partition.

              version
                     Display version information and a copyright message.
