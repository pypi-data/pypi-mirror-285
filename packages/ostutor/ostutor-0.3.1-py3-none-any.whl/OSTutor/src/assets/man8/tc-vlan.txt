NAME
       vlan - vlan manipulation module

SYNOPSIS
       tc ... action vlan { pop | PUSH | MODIFY } [ CONTROL ]

       PUSH := push [ protocol VLANPROTO ]  [ priority VLANPRIO ] id VLANID

       MODIFY  :=  modify  [  protocol  VLANPROTO  ]  [ priority VLANPRIO ] id
               VLANID

       CONTROL := { reclassify | pipe | drop | continue | pass  |  goto  chain
               CHAIN_INDEX }

DESCRIPTION
       The  vlan  action  allows  to  perform 802.1Q en- or decapsulation on a
       packet, reflected by the operation modes POP, PUSH and MODIFY.  The POP
       mode  is simple, as no further information is required to just drop the
       outer-most VLAN encapsulation. The PUSH and  MODIFY  modes  require  at
       least a VLANID and allow to optionally choose the VLANPROTO to use.

OPTIONS
       pop    Decapsulation mode, no further arguments allowed.

       push   Encapsulation mode. Requires at least id option.

       modify Replace mode. Existing 802.1Q tag is replaced. Requires at least
              id option.

       id VLANID
              Specify the VLAN ID to encapsulate into.  VLANID is an  unsigned
              16bit integer, the format is detected automatically (e.g. prefix
              with '0x' for hexadecimal interpretation, etc.).

       protocol VLANPROTO
              Choose the VLAN protocol to use. At the  time  of  writing,  the
              kernel accepts only 802.1Q or 802.1ad.

       priority VLANPRIO
              Choose the VLAN priority to use. Decimal number in range of 0-7.

       CONTROL
              How to continue after executing this action.

              reclassify
                     Restarts classification by jumping back to the first fil-
                     ter attached to this action's parent.

              pipe   Continue with the next action, this is the default.

              drop   Packet will be dropped without running further actions.

              continue
                     Continue classification with next filter in line.

              pass   Return to calling qdisc for packet processing. This  ends
                     the classification process.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  example encapsulates incoming ICMP packets on eth0 from
       10.0.0.2 into VLAN ID 123:

              #tc qdisc add dev eth0 handle ffff: ingress
              #tc filter add dev eth0 parent ffff: pref 11 protocol ip \
                   u32 match ip protocol 1 0xff flowid 1:1 \
                       match ip src 10.0.0.2 flowid 1:1 \
                   action vlan push id 123

       Here is an example of the pop function: Incoming VLAN packets  on  eth0
       are  decapsulated and the classification process then restarted for the
       plain packet:

              #tc qdisc add dev eth0 handle ffff: ingress
              #tc filter add dev $ETH parent ffff: pref 1 protocol 802.1Q \
                   u32 match u32 0 0 flowid 1:1 \
                   action vlan pop reclassify
