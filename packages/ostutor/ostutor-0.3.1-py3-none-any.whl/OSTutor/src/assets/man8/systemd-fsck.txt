NAME
       systemd-fsck@.service, systemd-fsck-root.service, systemd-fsck - File
       system checker logic

SYNOPSIS
       systemd-fsck@.service

       systemd-fsck-root.service

       /lib/systemd/systemd-fsck

DESCRIPTION
       systemd-fsck@.service and systemd-fsck-root.service are services
       responsible for file system checks. They are instantiated for each
       device that is configured for file system checking.
       systemd-fsck-root.service is responsible for file system checks on the
       root file system, but only if the root filesystem was not checked in
       the initramfs.  systemd-fsck@.service is used for all other file
       systems and for the root file system in the initramfs.

       These services are started at boot if passno in /etc/fstab for the file
       system is set to a value greater than zero. The file system check for
       root is performed before the other file systems. Other file systems may
       be checked in parallel, except when they are on the same rotating disk.

       systemd-fsck does not know any details about specific filesystems, and
       simply executes file system checkers specific to each filesystem type
       (/sbin/fsck.type). These checkers will decide if the filesystem should
       actually be checked based on the time since last check, number of
       mounts, unclean unmount, etc.

       If a file system check fails for a service without nofail, emergency
       mode is activated, by isolating to emergency.target.

KERNEL COMMAND LINE
       systemd-fsck understands these kernel command line parameters:

       fsck.mode=
           One of "auto", "force", "skip". Controls the mode of operation. The
           default is "auto", and ensures that file system checks are done
           when the file system checker deems them necessary.  "force"
           unconditionally results in full file system checks.  "skip" skips
           any file system checks.

       fsck.repair=
           One of "preen", "yes", "no". Controls the mode of operation. The
           default is "preen", and will automatically repair problems that can
           be safely fixed.  "yes" will answer yes to all questions by fsck
           and "no" will answer no to all questions.
