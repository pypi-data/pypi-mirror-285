NAME
       radius.so - RADIUS authentication plugin for pppd(8)

SYNOPSIS
       pppd [ options ] plugin radius.so

DESCRIPTION
       The  RADIUS  plugin for pppd permits pppd to perform PAP, CHAP, MS-CHAP
       and MS-CHAPv2 authentication against a RADIUS  server  instead  of  the
       usual /etc/ppp/pap-secrets and /etc/ppp/chap-secrets files.

       The  RADIUS  plugin is built on a library called radiusclient which has
       its own configuration files  (usually  in  /etc/radiusclient),  consult
       those files for more information on configuring the RADIUS plugin

OPTIONS
       The RADIUS plugin introduces one additional pppd option:

       radius-config-file filename
              The  file  filename  is  taken as the radiusclient configuration
              file.  If this option is not used, then the plugin uses /etc/ra-
              diusclient/radiusclient.conf as the configuration file.

       avpair attribute=value
              Adds  an  Attribute-Value  pair  to  be  passed on to the RADIUS
              server on each request.

       map-to-ifname
              Sets Radius NAS-Port attribute to number equal to interface name
              (Default)

       map-to-ttyname
              Sets Radius NAS-Port attribute value via libradiusclient library

USAGE
       To  use  the plugin, simply supply the plugin radius.so option to pppd,
       and edit /etc/radiusclient/radiusclient.conf appropriately.  If you use
       the  RADIUS  plugin,  the  normal  pppd  authentication schemes (login,
       checking the /etc/ppp/*-secrets files) are skipped.  The RADIUS  server
       should  assign an IP address to the peer using the RADIUS Framed-IP-Ad-
       dress attribute.
