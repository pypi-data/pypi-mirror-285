NAME
       xmkmf - create a Makefile from an Imakefile

SYNOPSIS
       xmkmf [ -a ] [ topdir [ curdir ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       The xmkmf command is the normal way to create a Makefile from an Imake-
       file shipped with third-party software.

       When invoked with no arguments in a directory containing an  Imakefile,
       the  imake  program  is  run with arguments appropriate for your system
       (configured into imake when it was built) and generates a Makefile.

       When invoked with the -a option, xmkmf builds the Makefile in the  cur-
       rent  directory, and then automatically executes ``make Makefiles'' (in
       case there are subdirectories), ``make includes'', and ``make  depend''
       for you.

       If a topdir is given, xmkmf assumes nothing is installed on your system
       and looks for files in the build tree instead of  using  the  installed
       versions.   Optionally,  curdir may be specified as a relative pathname
       from the top of the build tree to the current directory.  It is  neces-
       sary  to  supply curdir if the current directory has subdirectories, or
       the Makefile will not be able to build the subdirectories.
