NAME
       dh_dpatch_patch - apply patches listed in debian/patches/00list

SYNOPSIS
       dh_dpatch_patch [debhelper options]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_dpatch_patch simply calls dpatch apply-all .  All patches listed in
       debian/patches/00list are then applied in the current directory. The
       command does not fail if the patches have already been applied.

EXAMPLES
       dh_dpatch_patch is usually called indirectly in a rules file via the dh
       command.

               %:
                       dh --with dpatch $@

       It can also be direcly called at the start of the build (or configure)
       rule.

               build:
                       dh_dpatch_patch
                       ./configure
                       $(MAKE)
