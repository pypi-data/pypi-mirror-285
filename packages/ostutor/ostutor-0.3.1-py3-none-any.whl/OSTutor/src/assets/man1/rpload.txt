NAME
       rpload - alpine remote data utility

SYNTAX
       rpload [ -f ] [ -s trimSize ] -t Type -l Local_file -r Remote_folder

DESCRIPTION
       Rpload  may  be used to convert local Alpine configuration files or ad-
       dress books into remote configurations or address  books.   It  is  in-
       tended  to be used by system administrators.  Regular users should nor-
       mally use the facilities provided within Alpine.

       Local_file will usually be a user's alpine configuration file, and  Re-
       mote_folder  is  the  IMAP  folder which will be used (with the help of
       Alpine's -p, -P, and -x commands or PINECONF, PINERC, and PINERCEX  en-
       vironment variables) as the user's remote configuration folder.  A copy
       of Local_file will be placed in the  folder  with  the  correct  header
       lines to satisfy Alpine.

       -f                  Force  the load even if the remote folder is in the
                           wrong format.  This will delete the contents of the
                           folder so use it carefully.

       -s trimSize         If  the  number of messages in the remote folder is
                           more than one plus trimsize (one is for the  header
                           message),  then  messages  2,  3, and so on will be
                           deleted until there are only one plus trimsize mes-
                           sages  left.  If this option is not set no trimming
                           will be done.

       -t Type             The possible Types  are  pinerc,  abook,  and  sig.
                           (Sig  is  mostly  obsolete. Literal signatures con-
                           tained within the remote pinerc should be used  in-
                           stead.)

       -l Local_file       The file on this system that is to be copied.

       -r Remote_folder    A  remote  folder  name  to  be copied to.  See the
                           Alpine documentation for the  syntax  of  a  remote
                           folder name.  One example is
                           {my.imap.server}remote_pinerc.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Exit status is zero if all goes well, -1 otherwise.
