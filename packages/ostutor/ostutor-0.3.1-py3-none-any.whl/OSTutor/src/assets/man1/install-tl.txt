NAME
       install-tl - TeX Live cross-platform installer

SYNOPSIS
       install-tl [option]...

       install-tl-windows.bat [option]...

       install-tl-advanced.bat [option]...

DESCRIPTION
       This installer creates a runnable TeX Live installation from various
       media, including over the network, from local hard disk, a DVD, etc.
       The installer works on all platforms supported by TeX Live. For
       information on initially downloading TeX Live, see
       <https://tug.org/texlive/acquire.html>.

       The basic idea of TeX Live installation is for you to choose one of the
       top-level schemes, each of which is defined as a different set of
       collections and packages, where a collection is a set of packages, and
       a package is what contains actual files.

       Within the installer, you can choose a scheme, and further customize
       the set of collections to install, but not the set of the packages.  To
       work at the package level, use "tlmgr" (reference just below) after the
       initial installation is complete.

       The default is "scheme-full", which installs everything, and this is
       highly recommended.

REFERENCES
       Post-installation configuration, package updates, and more, are handled
       through tlmgr(1), the TeX Live Manager
       (<https://tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html>).

       The most up-to-date version of this installer documentation is on the
       Internet at <https://tug.org/texlive/doc/install-tl.html>.

OPTIONS
       As usual, all options can be specified in any order, and with either a
       leading "-" or "--".  An argument value can be separated from its
       option by either a space or "=".

       -gui [[=]module]
           If no module is given, starts the Tcl/Tk (see below) GUI installer.

           If module is given loads the given installer module. Currently the
           following modules are supported:

           "text"
               The text mode user interface (default on Unix systems).  Same
               as the "-no-gui" option.

           "tcl"
               The Tcl/Tk user interface (default on Macs and Windows).  It
               starts with a small number of configuration options, roughly
               equivalent to what the wizard option below offers, but a button
               "Advanced" takes you to a screen with roughly the same options
               as the "perltk" interface.

           "wizard"
               The wizard mode user interface, asking only minimal questions
               before installing all of TeX Live.

           "expert"
               A generic name for, currently, "perltk"; it may select a
               different GUI in the future.

           "perltk"
               The expert GUI installer, providing access to more options.

           The "perltk" and "wizard" modules require the Perl/Tk module
           (<https://tug.org/texlive/distro.html#perltk>). if Perl/Tk is not
           available, installation continues in text mode, except on Windows,
           where all gui options except "text" are diverted to the default
           "tcl" GUI.

           The "tcl" GUI requires Tcl/Tk. This is standard on Macs and is
           often already installed on GNU/Linux. For Windows, TeX Live
           provides a Tcl/Tk runtime.

       -no-gui
           Use the text mode installer (default except on Windows and Macs).

       -lang llcode
           By default, the GUI tries to deduce your language from the
           environment. The Tcl GUI uses the language detection built into
           Tcl/Tk; the Perl/Tk GUIs use the "LC_MESSAGES" environment
           variable. If that fails you can select a different language by
           giving this option with a language code (based on ISO 639-1).
           Currently supported (but not necessarily completely translated)
           are: English (en, default), Czech (cs), German (de), French (fr),
           Italian (it), Japanese (ja), Dutch (nl), Polish (pl), Brazilian
           Portuguese (pt_BR), Russian (ru), Slovak (sk), Slovenian (sl),
           Serbian (sr), Ukrainian (uk), Vietnamese (vi), simplified Chinese
           (zh_CN), and traditional Chinese (zh_TW).

       -repository url|path
           Specify the package repository to be used as the source of the
           installation. In short, this can be a directory name or a url using
           http(s), ftp, or scp. The documentation for "tlmgr" has the details
           (<https://tug.org/texlive/doc/tlmgr.html#OPTIONS>).

           For installation, the default is to pick a mirror automatically,
           using <http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet>; the chosen
           mirror is used for the entire download. You can use the special
           argument "ctan" as an abbreviation for this. (See
           <https://ctan.org> for more about CTAN and its mirrors.)

           After installation is complete, you can use that installation as
           the repository for another installation.  If you chose to install
           less than the full scheme containing all packages, the list of
           available schemes will be adjusted accordingly.

       -select-repository
           This option allows you to choose a particular mirror from the
           current list of active CTAN mirrors. This option is supported in
           the "text", "wizard" and "perltk" installer modes, and will also
           offer to install from local media if available, or from a
           repository specified on the command line. It's useful when the
           (default) automatic redirection does not choose a good host for
           you.

       -all-options
           Normally options not relevant to the current platform are not shown
           (e.g., when running on Unix, Windows-specific options are omitted).
           Giving this command line option allows configuring such "foreign"
           settings.

       -custom-bin path
           If you have built your own set of TeX Live binaries (perhaps
           because your platform was not supported by TeX Live out of the
           box), this option allows you to specify the path to a directory
           where the binaries for the current system are present.  The
           installation will continue as usual, but at the end all files from
           path are copied over to "bin/custom/" under your installation
           directory and this "bin/custom/" directory is what will be added to
           the path for the post-install actions.  To install multiple custom
           binary sets, manually rename "custom" before doing each.

           For more information on custom binaries, see
           <https://tug.org/texlive/custom-bin.html>.  For general information
           on building TeX Live, see <https://tug.org/texlive/build.html>.

       -debug-translation
           In the Perl/Tk GUI modes, this option reports any missing, or more
           likely untranslated, messages to standard error. Helpful for
           translators to see what remains to be done.

       -force-platform platform
           Instead of auto-detecting the current platform, use platform.
           Binaries for this platform must be present and they must actually
           be runnable, or installation will fail.  "-force-arch" is a
           synonym.

       -help, --help, -?
           Display this help and exit. (This help is also on the web at
           <https://tug.org/texlive/doc/install-tl.html>). Sometimes the
           "perldoc" and/or "PAGER" programs on the system have problems,
           possibly resulting in control characters being literally output.
           This can't always be detected, but you can set the "NOPERLDOC"
           environment variable and "perldoc" will not be used.

       -in-place
           This is a quick-and-dirty installation option in case you already
           have an rsync or svn checkout of TeX Live.  It will use the
           checkout as-is and will just do the necessary post-install.  Be
           warned that the file "tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb" may be rewritten, that
           removal has to be done manually, and that the only realistic way to
           maintain this installation is to redo it from time to time.  This
           option is not available via the installer interfaces.  USE AT YOUR
           OWN RISK.

       -init-from-profile profile_file
           Similar to -profile (see "PROFILES" below), but only initializes
           the installation configuration from profile_file and then starts a
           normal interactive session. Environment variables are not ignored.

       -logfile file
           Write both all messages (informational, debugging, warnings) to
           file, in addition to standard output or standard error.

           If this option is not given, the installer will create a log file
           in the root of the writable installation tree, for example,
           "/usr/local/texlive/YYYY/install-tl.log" for the YYYY release.

       -no-cls
           For the text mode installer only: do not clear the screen when
           entering a new menu (for debugging purposes).

       -no-persistent-downloads
       -persistent-downloads
           For network installs, activating this option makes the installer
           try to set up a persistent connection using the "Net::LWP" Perl
           module.  This opens only one connection between your computer and
           the server per session and reuses it, instead of initiating a new
           download for each package, which typically yields a significant
           speed-up.

           This option is turned on by default, and the installation program
           will fall back to using "wget" if this is not possible.  To disable
           usage of LWP and persistent connections, use
           "-no-persistent-downloads".

       -no-verify-downloads
           By default, if a GnuPG "gpg" binary is found in PATH, downloads are
           verified against a cryptographic signature. This option disables
           such verification.  The full description is in the Crytographic
           Verification section of the "tlmgr" documentation, e.g.,
           <https://tug.org/texlive/doc/tlmgr.html#CRYPTOGRAPHIC-VERIFICATION>

       -non-admin
           For Windows only: configure for the current user, not for all
           users.

       -portable
           Install for portable use, e.g., on a USB stick.  Also selectable
           from within the perltk and text installers.

       -print-platform
           Print the TeX Live identifier for the detected platform
           (hardware/operating system) combination to standard output, and
           exit.  "-print-arch" is a synonym.

       -profile profile_file
           Load profile_file and do the installation with no user interaction,
           that is, a batch (unattended) install.  Environment variables are
           ignored. See "PROFILES" below.

       -q  Omit normal informational messages.

       -scheme scheme
           Schemes are the highest level of package grouping in TeX Live; the
           default is to use the "full" scheme, which includes everything.
           This option overrides that default.  You can change the scheme
           again before the actual installation with the usual menu.  The
           scheme argument may optionally have a prefix "scheme-".  The list
           of supported scheme names depends on what your package repository
           provides; see the interactive menu list.

       -v  Include verbose debugging messages; repeat for maximum debugging:
           "-v -v".  (Further repeats are accepted but ignored.)

       -version, --version
           Output version information and exit.  If "-v" is also given, the
           versions of the TeX Live modules used are also reported.

PROFILES
       A profile file contains all the values needed to perform an
       installation.  After a normal installation has finished, a profile for
       that exact installation is written to the file "tlpkg/texlive.profile".
       In addition, from the text menu one can select "P" to save the current
       setup as a profile at any time.

       Such a profile file can be given as the argument to "-profile", for
       example to redo the exact same installation on a different system.
       Alternatively, you can use a custom profile, most easily created by
       starting from a generated one and changing values, or an empty file,
       which will take all the defaults.

       As mentioned above, the installer only supports selection by scheme and
       collections, not individual packages, so packages cannot be specified
       in profile files either. Use "tlmgr" to work at the package level.

       Within a profile file, each line consists of

       variable [value]

       except for comment lines starting with "#".  The possible variable
       names are listed below.  Values, when present, are either 0 or 1 for
       booleans, or strings (which must be specified without any quote
       characters).  Leading whitespace is ignored.

       If the variable "selected_scheme" is defined and no collection
       variables at all are defined, then the collections required by the
       specified scheme (which might change over time) are installed, without
       explicitly listing them.  This eases maintenance of profile files.  If
       any collections are specified in a profile, though, then all desired
       collections must be given explicitly.

       For example, a line

         selected_scheme scheme-small

       along with definitions for the installation directories (given below
       under "path options") suffices to install the "small" scheme with all
       default options.  The schemes are described in the "S" menu in the text
       installer, or equivalent.

       Besides "selected_scheme", here is the list of variable names supported
       in a profile:

       collection options (prefix "collection-")

       Collections are specified with a variable name with the prefix
       "collection-" followed by a collection name; there is no value.  For
       instance, "collection-basic".  The collections are described in the "C"
       menu.

       Schemes and collections (and packages) are ultimately defined by the
       files in the "tlpkg/tlpsrc/" source directory.

       path options

       It is best to define all of these, even though they may not be used in
       the installation, so as to avoid unintentionally getting a default
       value that could cause problems later.

         TEXDIR
         TEXMFCONFIG
         TEXMFVAR
         TEXMFHOME
         TEXMFLOCAL
         TEXMFSYSCONFIG
         TEXMFSYSVAR

       installer options (prefix "instopt_")

       "instopt_adjustpath" (default 0 on Unix, 1 on Windows)
           Adjust "PATH" environment variable.

       "instopt_adjustrepo" (default 1)
           Set remote repository to a multiplexed CTAN mirror after
           installation; see "-repository" above.

       "instopt_letter" (default 0)
           Set letter size paper as the default, instead of a4.

       "instopt_portable" (default 0)
           Install for portable use, e.g., on a USB stick.

       "instopt_write18_restricted" (default 1)
           Enable "\write18" for a restricted set of programs.

       tlpdb options (prefix "tlpdbopt_")

       The definitive list is given in "tlpkg/TeXLive/TLConfig.pm", in the
       hash %TeXLive::TLConfig::TLPDBOptions, together with explanations.  All
       items given there except for "tlpdbopt_location" can be specified.
       Here is the current list:

         tlpdbopt_autobackup
         tlpdbopt_backupdir
         tlpdbopt_create_formats
         tlpdbopt_desktop_integration
         tlpdbopt_file_assocs
         tlpdbopt_generate_updmap
         tlpdbopt_install_docfiles
         tlpdbopt_install_srcfiles
         tlpdbopt_post_code
         tlpdbopt_sys_bin
         tlpdbopt_sys_info
         tlpdbopt_sys_man
         tlpdbopt_w32_multi_user

       platform options (prefix "binary_")

       For each supported platform in TeX Live (directories under "bin/"), the
       variable "binary_"PLATFORM can be set with value 1.  For example:

         binary_x86_64-linux 1

       If no "binary_" settings are made, the default is whatever the current
       machine is running.

       In releases before 2017, many profile variables had different names
       (not documented here; see the "install-tl" source).  They are accepted
       and transformed to the names given above.  When a profile is written,
       the names above are always used.

       For more details on all of the above options, consult the TeX Live
       installation manual, linked from <https://tug.org/texlive/doc>.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       For ease in scripting and debugging, "install-tl" looks for the
       following environment variables. They are not of interest for normal
       user installations.

       "TEXLIVE_DOWNLOADER"
       "TL_DOWNLOAD_PROGRAM"
       "TL_DOWNLOAD_ARGS"
           These override the normal choice of a download program; see the
           "tlmgr" documentation, e.g.,
           <https://tug.org/texlive/doc/tlmgr.html#ENVIRONMENT-VARIABLES>.

       "TEXLIVE_INSTALL_ENV_NOCHECK"
           Omit the check for environment variables containing the string
           "tex".  People developing TeX-related software are likely to have
           many such variables.

       "TEXLIVE_INSTALL_NO_CONTEXT_CACHE"
           Omit creating the ConTeXt cache.  This is useful for
           redistributors.

       "TEXLIVE_INSTALL_NO_IMPORT"
           Omit check for installing on top of a previous installation and
           then asking about importing previous settings.

       "TEXLIVE_INSTALL_NO_WELCOME"
           Omit printing the welcome message after successful installation,
           e.g., when testing.

       "TEXLIVE_INSTALL_PREFIX"
       "TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXDIR"
       "TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFCONFIG"
       "TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFVAR"
       "TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFHOME"
       "TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFLOCAL"
       "TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFSYSCONFIG"
       "TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFSYSVAR"
           Specify the respective directories.  "TEXLIVE_INSTALL_PREFIX"
           defaults to "/usr/local/texlive", while "TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXDIR"
           defaults to the release directory within that prefix, e.g.,
           "/usr/local/texlive/2016".  All the defaults can be seen by running
           the installer interactively and then typing "D" for the directory
           menu.

       "NOPERLDOC"
           Don't try to run the "--help" message through "perldoc".
