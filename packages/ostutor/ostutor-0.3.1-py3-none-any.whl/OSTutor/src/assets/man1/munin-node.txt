NAME
       munin-node - A daemon to gather information in cooperation with the
       main Munin program

SYNOPSIS
       munin-node [--options]

DESCRIPTION
       munin-node is a daemon for reporting statistics on system performance.

       It doesn't produce these itself, but instead relies on a number of
       plugins which are responsible for gathering the data they require, and
       describing how this should be graphed.  In fact, it does little more
       than fielding requests from the Munin master, running the appropriate
       plugins, and returning the output they produce.

OPTIONS
       --config <configfile>
            Use <file> as configuration file. [/etc/munin/munin-node.conf]

        --[no]paranoia
            Only run plugins owned by root. Check permissions as well.
            [--noparanoia]

        --help
            View this help message.

        --[no]debug
            View debug messages.  This can be very verbose.

        --[no]pidebug
            Plugin debug.  Sets the environment variable MUNIN_DEBUG to 1 so
            that plugins may enable debugging. [--nopidebug]

       For information on configuration options, please refer to the man page
       for munin-node.conf.

       Many plugins can report whether or not they can reasonably be used on
       the node.  "munin-node-configure" can use this information to help
       manage installed plugins.

       The network protocol is documented at
