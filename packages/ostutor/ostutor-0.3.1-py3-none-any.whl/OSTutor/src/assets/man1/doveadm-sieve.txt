NAME
       doveadm-sieve - Commands related to handling Sieve scripts

SYNOPSIS
       doveadm [-Dv] [-f formatter] sieve_cmd [options] [arguments]

DESCRIPTION
       The  doveadm sieve commands are part of the Pigeonhole Project (pigeon-
       hole(7)), which adds Sieve (RFC 5228) and ManageSieve (RFC  5804)  sup-
       port  to  the  Dovecot  secure  IMAP  and POP3 server (dovecot(1)). The
       doveadm sieve commands can be used to manage Sieve filtering.

OPTIONS
       Global doveadm(1) options:

       -D     Enables verbosity and debug messages.

       -f formatter
              Specifies the formatter for formatting  the  output.   Supported
              formatters are:

              flow   prints each line with key=value pairs.

              pager  prints each key: value pair on its own line and separates
                     records with form feed character (^L).

              tab    prints a table header followed  by  tab  separated  value
                     lines.

              table  prints a table header followed by adjusted value lines.

       -o setting=value
              Overrides  the  configuration  setting  from  /etc/dovecot/dove-
              cot.conf and from the userdb with the given value.  In order  to
              override  multiple settings, the -o option may be specified mul-
              tiple times.

       -v     Enables verbosity, including progress counter.

       Command specific options:

       -A     If the -A option is present, the command will be  performed  for
              all  users.   Using this option in combination with system users
              from userdb { driver = passwd } is not recommended,  because  it
              contains  also  users  with  a lower UID than the one configured
              with the first_valid_uid setting.

              When the SQL userdb module is used  make  sure  that  the  iter-
              ate_query  setting  in /etc/dovecot/dovecot-sql.conf.ext matches
              your database layout.  When using the LDAP userdb  module,  make
              sure  that  the  iterate_attrs  and  iterate_filter  settings in
              /etc/dovecot/dovecot-ldap.conf.ext match your LDAP schema.  Oth-
              erwise doveadm(1) will be unable to iterate over all users.

       -S socket_path
              The option's argument is either an absolute path to a local UNIX
              domain socket, or a hostname and port (hostname:port), in  order
              to connect a remote host via a TCP socket.

              This allows an administrator to execute doveadm(1) mail commands
              through the given socket.

       -u user/mask
              Run the command only for the given user.  It's also possible  to
              use '*' and '?' wildcards (e.g. -u *@example.org).
              When  neither  the -A option nor -u user was specified, the com-
              mand will be executed with  the  environment  of  the  currently
              logged in user.

ARGUMENTS
       scriptname
              Is  the  name  of  a  Sieve script,  as  visible  to ManageSieve
              clients.

              NOTE: For Sieve scripts that are stored on  disk,  this  is  the
              filename without the ".sieve" extension.

COMMANDS
   sieve put
       doveadm sieve put [-A|-u user] [-S socket_path] [-a] scriptname

       This  command  puts  one  new  Sieve  script in the script storage. The
       script is read from standard input. If  the  script  compiles  success-
       fully,  it  is stored under the provided scriptname .  If the -a option
       is present, the Sieve script  is  subsequently  marked  as  the  active
       script for execution at delivery.

   sieve get
       doveadm sieve get [-A|-u user] [-S socket_path] scriptname

       This command retrieves the Sieve script named scriptname.

   sieve delete
       doveadm sieve delete [-A|-u user] [-S socket_path] [-a] scriptname ...

       This  command deletes one or more Sieve scripts. The deleted script may
       not be the active script, unless the -a option is present.

   sieve list
       doveadm sieve list [-A|-u user] [-S socket_path] scriptname

       Use this command to get an overview of existing Sieve scripts.

   sieve rename
       doveadm sieve rename [-A|-u user] [-S socket_path] old_name new_name

       The sieve rename command is used to rename the Sieve script old_name to
       new_name.

   sieve activate
       doveadm sieve activate [-A|-u user] [-S socket_path] scriptname

       This  command  marks  the  Sieve  script named scriptname as the active
       script for execution at delivery.

   sieve deactivate
       doveadm sieve deactivate [-A|-u user] [-S socket_path] scriptname

       This command deactivates Sieve processing.
