NAME
       munin-run - A program to run Munin plugins from the command line

SYNOPSIS
       munin-run [options] <plugin> [ config | autoconf | snmpconf | suggest ]

DESCRIPTION
       munin-run is a script to run Munin plugins from the command-line.  It's
       useful when debugging plugins, as they are run in the same conditions
       as they are under munin-node.

OPTIONS
       --config <configfile>
            Use <file> as configuration file. [/etc/munin/munin-node.conf]

       --servicedir <dir>
            Use <dir> as plugin dir. [/etc/munin/plugins/]

       --sconfdir <dir>
            Use <dir> as plugin configuration dir. [/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/]

       --sconffile <file>
            Use <file> as plugin configuration. Overrides sconfdir.
            [undefined]

       --paranoia
            Only run plugins owned by root and check permissions.  [disabled]

       --ignore-systemd-properties
            Do not try to detect and enforce the locally configured hardening
            flags of the "munin-node" service unit. This detection is skipped,
            if systemd is not enabled.  The hardening flags may cause subtile
            surprises.  For example "ProtectHome=yes" prevents the "df" plugin
            from determining the state of the "home" partition.  [disabled]

       --help
            View this help message.

       --debug
            Print debug messages.  Debug messages are sent to STDOUT and are
            prefixed with "#" (this makes it easier for other parts of munin
            to use munin-run and still have --debug on).  Only errors go to
            STDERR.

       --pidebug
            Plugin debug.  Sets the environment variable MUNIN_DEBUG to 1 so
            that plugins may enable debugging.  [disabled]

       --version
            Show version information.

NOTES FOR SYSTEMD USERS
       The "munin-node" service is usually started by systemd via a
       "munin-node.service" definition.  Some distributions enable hardening
       settings in this service file in order to restrict the allowed set of
       activities for the "munin-node" process.  This may cause surprising
       differences between the result of "munin-run" and the real "munin-node"
       service.

       A popular example of such a surprising restriction is "ProtectHome=yes"
       combined with the "df" plugin.  The restriction silently prevents the
       plugin from determining the status of mountpoints below /home.

       "munin-run" tries to mimic this behavior of "munin-node" automatically.
       Thus the execution of "munin-run df" should provide the same output as
       "echo fetch df | nc localhost munin".

       If you want to debug potential issues of systemd restrictions, then you
       may want to use the parameters "--ignore-systemd-properties" and
       "--debug".  Permanent overrides of systemd properties can be configured
       locally via "systemctl edit munin-node".  See "man systemd.exec" for
       the documentation of systemd's properties.
