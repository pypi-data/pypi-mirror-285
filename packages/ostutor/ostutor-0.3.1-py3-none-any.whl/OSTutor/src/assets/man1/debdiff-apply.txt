NAME
       debdiff-apply - apply a debdiff to a Debian source package

SYNOPSIS
       debdiff-apply [options] [orig_dsc_or_dir] [patch_file]
       debdiff-apply [options] < [patch_file]

DESCRIPTION
       debdiff-apply  takes a patchfile that describes the differences between
       two Debian source packages old and new, and applies it to a target  De-
       bian source package orig.

       orig  could either be the same as old or it could be different.  patch-
       file is expected to be a unified diff between two Debian source  trees,
       as what debdiff(1) normally generates.

       Any  changes to debian/changelog are dealt with specially, to avoid the
       conflicts that changelog diffs typically produce when applied  naively.
       The  exact  behaviour  may  be tweaked in the future, so one should not
       rely on it.

       If patchfile does not apply to orig, even after the  special-casing  of
       debian/changelog,  no  changes  are made and debdiff-apply(1) will exit
       with a non-zero error code.

ARGUMENTS
       orig_dsc_or_dir
              Target to apply the patch to. This can  either  be  an  unpacked
              source  tree,  or a .dsc file. In the former case, the directory
              is modified in-place; in the latter case, a second .dsc is  cre-
              ated. Default: .

       patch_file
              Patch  file  to  apply, in the format output by debdiff(1).  De-
              fault: /dev/stdin

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       -v, --verbose
              Output more information

       -c CHANGELOG, --changelog CHANGELOG
              Path to debian/changelog; default: debian/changelog

       -D DISTRIBUTION, --distribution DISTRIBUTION
              Distribution to use, if the  patch  doesn't  already  contain  a
              changelog; default: experimental

       --repl Run the python REPL after processing.

       --source-version
              Don't  apply  the  patch;  instead  print out the version of the
              package that it is supposed to be applied to, or nothing if  the
              patch does not specify a source version.

       --target-version
              Don't  apply the patch; instead print out the new version of the
              package debdiff-apply(1) would generate, when the patch  is  ap-
              plied to the the given target package, as specified by the other
              arguments.

   For .dsc patch targets:
       --no-clean
              Don't clean temporary directories after a failure,  so  you  can
              examine what failed.

       --quilt-refresh
              If  the building of the new source package fails, try to refresh
              patches using quilt(1) then try building it again.

       -d DIRECTORY, --directory DIRECTORY
              Extract the .dsc into this directory, which won't be cleaned  up
              after  debdiff-apply(1) exits. If not given, then it will be ex-
              tracted to a temporary directory.
