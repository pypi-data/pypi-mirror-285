NAME
       dh_phpcomposer - calculates PHP Composer substvars

SYNOPSIS
       dh_phpcomposer [debhelperoptions] [options]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_phpcomposer is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       generating the ${phpcomposer:*} substitutions and adding them to
       substvars files.

       The program will look for composer.json file in the package root, and
       will use this information to generate:

       o ${phpcomposer:name} and ${phpcomposer:description}

       o ${phpcomposer:Debian-require}, ${phpcomposer:Debian-require-dev},
         ${phpcomposer:Debian-conflict}, ${phpcomposer:Debian-replace},
         ${phpcomposer:Debian-provide}, ${phpcomposer:Debian-suggest} and
         ${phpcomposer:Debian-recommend}

       Those variables will be substituted into the package's control file
       wherever the token ${phpcomposer:*} are placed.

       This feature requires pkg-php-tools (>= 1.7~).

OPTIONS
       --sourcedirectory=directory
           Assume that the original package source tree is at the specified
           directory rather than the top level directory of the Debian source
           package tree.

           This feature requires pkg-php-tools (>= 1.14~).
