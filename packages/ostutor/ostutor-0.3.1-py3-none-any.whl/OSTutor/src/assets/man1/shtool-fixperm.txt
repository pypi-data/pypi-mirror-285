NAME
       shtool-fixperm - GNU shtool file permission fixing command

SYNOPSIS
       shtool fixperm [-v|--verbose] [-t|--trace] path [path ...]

DESCRIPTION
       shtool fixperm fixes file permissions inside a source tree under path
       by cleaning up the permission bits. It determines the cleaned up
       permission from the already set bits. It is intended to be run before a
       tarball is rolled (usually with shtool tarball) out of a source tree.
       The trick is that this is more convenient than having to set the
       permissions manually or by using a large file list.

OPTIONS
       The following command line options are available.

       -v, --verbose
           Display some processing information.

       -t, --trace
           Enable the output of the essential shell commands which are
           executed.

EXAMPLE
        #   Makefile.in
