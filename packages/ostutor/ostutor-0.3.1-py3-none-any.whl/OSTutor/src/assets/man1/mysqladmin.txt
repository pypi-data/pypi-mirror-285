NAME
       mysqladmin - a MySQL server administration program

SYNOPSIS
       mysqladmin [options] command [command-options] [command
                                                                                      [command-options]]
                                                                                      ...

DESCRIPTION
       mysqladmin is a client for performing administrative operations. You
       can use it to check the server's configuration and current status, to
       create and drop databases, and more.

       Invoke mysqladmin like this:

           mysqladmin [options] command [command-arg] [command [command-arg]] ...

       mysqladmin supports the following commands. Some of the commands take
       an argument following the command name.

       o   create db_name

           Create a new database named db_name.

       o   debug

           Prior to MySQL 8.0.20, tell the server to write debug information
           to the error log. The connected user must have the SUPER privilege.
           Format and content of this information is subject to change.

           This includes information about the Event Scheduler. See
           Section 25.4.5, "Event Scheduler Status".

       o   drop db_name

           Delete the database named db_name and all its tables.

       o   extended-status

           Display the server status variables and their values.

       o   flush-hosts

           Flush all information in the host cache. See Section 5.1.12.3, "DNS
           Lookups and the Host Cache".

       o   flush-logs [log_type ...]

           Flush all logs.

           The mysqladmin flush-logs command permits optional log types to be
           given, to specify which logs to flush. Following the flush-logs
           command, you can provide a space-separated list of one or more of
           the following log types: binary, engine, error, general, relay,
           slow. These correspond to the log types that can be specified for
           the FLUSH LOGS SQL statement.

       o   flush-privileges

           Reload the grant tables (same as reload).

       o   flush-status

           Clear status variables.

       o   flush-tables

           Flush all tables.

       o   flush-threads

           Flush the thread cache.

       o   kill id,id,...

           Kill server threads. If multiple thread ID values are given, there
           must be no spaces in the list.

           To kill threads belonging to other users, the connected user must
           have the CONNECTION_ADMIN privilege (or the deprecated SUPER
           privilege).

       o   password new_password

           Set a new password. This changes the password to new_password for
           the account that you use with mysqladmin for connecting to the
           server. Thus, the next time you invoke mysqladmin (or any other
           client program) using the same account, you must specify the new
           password.

               Warning
               Setting a password using mysqladmin should be considered
               insecure. On some systems, your password becomes visible to
               system status programs such as ps that may be invoked by other
               users to display command lines. MySQL clients typically
               overwrite the command-line password argument with zeros during
               their initialization sequence. However, there is still a brief
               interval during which the value is visible. Also, on some
               systems this overwriting strategy is ineffective and the
               password remains visible to ps. (SystemV Unix systems and
               perhaps others are subject to this problem.)
           If the new_password value contains spaces or other characters that
           are special to your command interpreter, you need to enclose it
           within quotation marks. On Windows, be sure to use double quotation
           marks rather than single quotation marks; single quotation marks
           are not stripped from the password, but rather are interpreted as
           part of the password. For example:

               mysqladmin password "my new password"

           The new password can be omitted following the password command. In
           this case, mysqladmin prompts for the password value, which enables
           you to avoid specifying the password on the command line. Omitting
           the password value should be done only if password is the final
           command on the mysqladmin command line. Otherwise, the next
           argument is taken as the password.

               Caution
               Do not use this command used if the server was started with the
               --skip-grant-tables option. No password change is applied. This
               is true even if you precede the password command with
               flush-privileges on the same command line to re-enable the
               grant tables because the flush operation occurs after you
               connect. However, you can use mysqladmin flush-privileges to
               re-enable the grant table and then use a separate mysqladmin
               password command to change the password.

       o   ping

           Check whether the server is available. The return status from
           mysqladmin is 0 if the server is running, 1 if it is not. This is 0
           even in case of an error such as Access denied, because this means
           that the server is running but refused the connection, which is
           different from the server not running.

       o   processlist

           Show a list of active server threads. This is like the output of
           the SHOW PROCESSLIST statement. If the --verbose option is given,
           the output is like that of SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST. (See
           Section 13.7.7.29, "SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement".)

       o   reload

           Reload the grant tables.

       o   refresh

           Flush all tables and close and open log files.

       o   shutdown

           Stop the server.

       o   start-replica

           Start replication on a replica server. Use this command from MySQL
           8.0.26.

       o   start-slave

           Start replication on a replica server. Use this command before
           MySQL 8.0.26.

       o   status

           Display a short server status message.

       o   stop-replica

           Stop replication on a replica server. Use this command from MySQL
           8.0.26.

       o   stop-slave

           Stop replication on a replica server. Use this command before MySQL
           8.0.26.

       o   variables

           Display the server system variables and their values.

       o   version

           Display version information from the server.

       All commands can be shortened to any unique prefix. For example:

           $> mysqladmin proc stat
           +----+-------+-----------+----+---------+------+-------+------------------+
           | Id | User  | Host      | db | Command | Time | State | Info             |
           +----+-------+-----------+----+---------+------+-------+------------------+
           | 51 | jones | localhost |    | Query   | 0    |       | show processlist |
           +----+-------+-----------+----+---------+------+-------+------------------+
           Uptime: 1473624  Threads: 1  Questions: 39487
           Slow queries: 0  Opens: 541  Flush tables: 1
           Open tables: 19  Queries per second avg: 0.0268

       The mysqladmin status command result displays the following values:

       o   Uptime

           The number of seconds the MySQL server has been running.

       o   Threads

           The number of active threads (clients).

       o   Questions

           The number of questions (queries) from clients since the server was
           started.

       o   Slow queries

           The number of queries that have taken more than long_query_time
           seconds. See Section 5.4.5, "The Slow Query Log".

       o   Opens

           The number of tables the server has opened.

       o   Flush tables

           The number of flush-*, refresh, and reload commands the server has
           executed.

       o   Open tables

           The number of tables that currently are open.

       If you execute mysqladmin shutdown when connecting to a local server
       using a Unix socket file, mysqladmin waits until the server's process
       ID file has been removed, to ensure that the server has stopped
       properly.

       mysqladmin supports the following options, which can be specified on
       the command line or in the [mysqladmin] and [client] groups of an
       option file. For information about option files used by MySQL programs,
       see Section 4.2.2.2, "Using Option Files".

       o   --help, -?  Display a help message and exit.

       o   --bind-address=ip_address On a computer having multiple network
           interfaces, use this option to select which interface to use for
           connecting to the MySQL server.

       o   --character-sets-dir=dir_name The directory where character sets
           are installed. See Section 10.15, "Character Set Configuration".

       o   --compress, -C Compress all information sent between the client and
           the server if possible. See Section 4.2.8, "Connection Compression
           Control".

           As of MySQL 8.0.18, this option is deprecated. Expect it to be
           removed in a future version of MySQL. See the section called
           "Configuring Legacy Connection Compression".

       o   --compression-algorithms=value The permitted compression algorithms
           for connections to the server. The available algorithms are the
           same as for the protocol_compression_algorithms system variable.
           The default value is uncompressed.

           For more information, see Section 4.2.8, "Connection Compression
           Control".

           This option was added in MySQL 8.0.18.

       o   --connect-timeout=value The maximum number of seconds before
           connection timeout. The default value is 43200 (12 hours).

       o   --count=N, -c N The number of iterations to make for repeated
           command execution if the --sleep option is given.

       o   --debug[=debug_options], -# [debug_options] Write a debugging log.
           A typical debug_options string is d:t:o,file_name. The default is
           d:t:o,/tmp/mysqladmin.trace.

           This option is available only if MySQL was built using WITH_DEBUG.
           MySQL release binaries provided by Oracle are not built using this
           option.

       o   --debug-check Print some debugging information when the program
           exits.

           This option is available only if MySQL was built using WITH_DEBUG.
           MySQL release binaries provided by Oracle are not built using this
           option.

       o   --debug-info Print debugging information and memory and CPU usage
           statistics when the program exits.

           This option is available only if MySQL was built using WITH_DEBUG.
           MySQL release binaries provided by Oracle are not built using this
           option.

       o   --default-auth=plugin A hint about which client-side authentication
           plugin to use. See Section 6.2.17, "Pluggable Authentication".

       o   --default-character-set=charset_name Use charset_name as the
           default character set. See Section 10.15, "Character Set
           Configuration".

       o   --defaults-extra-file=file_name Read this option file after the
           global option file but (on Unix) before the user option file. If
           the file does not exist or is otherwise inaccessible, an error
           occurs. If file_name is not an absolute path name, it is
           interpreted relative to the current directory.

           For additional information about this and other option-file
           options, see Section 4.2.2.3, "Command-Line Options that Affect
           Option-File Handling".

       o   --defaults-file=file_name Use only the given option file. If the
           file does not exist or is otherwise inaccessible, an error occurs.
           If file_name is not an absolute path name, it is interpreted
           relative to the current directory.

           Exception: Even with --defaults-file, client programs read
           .mylogin.cnf.

           For additional information about this and other option-file
           options, see Section 4.2.2.3, "Command-Line Options that Affect
           Option-File Handling".

       o   --defaults-group-suffix=str Read not only the usual option groups,
           but also groups with the usual names and a suffix of str. For
           example, mysqladmin normally reads the [client] and [mysqladmin]
           groups. If this option is given as --defaults-group-suffix=_other,
           mysqladmin also reads the [client_other] and [mysqladmin_other]
           groups.

           For additional information about this and other option-file
           options, see Section 4.2.2.3, "Command-Line Options that Affect
           Option-File Handling".

       o   --enable-cleartext-plugin Enable the mysql_clear_password cleartext
           authentication plugin. (See Section 6.4.1.4, "Client-Side Cleartext
           Pluggable Authentication".)

       o   --force, -f Do not ask for confirmation for the drop db_name
           command. With multiple commands, continue even if an error occurs.

       o   --get-server-public-key Request from the server the public key
           required for RSA key pair-based password exchange. This option
           applies to clients that authenticate with the caching_sha2_password
           authentication plugin. For that plugin, the server does not send
           the public key unless requested. This option is ignored for
           accounts that do not authenticate with that plugin. It is also
           ignored if RSA-based password exchange is not used, as is the case
           when the client connects to the server using a secure connection.

           If --server-public-key-path=file_name is given and specifies a
           valid public key file, it takes precedence over
           --get-server-public-key.

           For information about the caching_sha2_password plugin, see
           Section 6.4.1.2, "Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication".

       o   --host=host_name, -h host_name Connect to the MySQL server on the
           given host.

       o   --login-path=name Read options from the named login path in the
           .mylogin.cnf login path file. A "login path" is an option group
           containing options that specify which MySQL server to connect to
           and which account to authenticate as. To create or modify a login
           path file, use the mysql_config_editor utility. See
           mysql_config_editor(1).

           For additional information about this and other option-file
           options, see Section 4.2.2.3, "Command-Line Options that Affect
           Option-File Handling".

       o   --no-beep, -b Suppress the warning beep that is emitted by default
           for errors such as a failure to connect to the server.

       o   --no-defaults Do not read any option files. If program startup
           fails due to reading unknown options from an option file,
           --no-defaults can be used to prevent them from being read.

           The exception is that the .mylogin.cnf file is read in all cases,
           if it exists. This permits passwords to be specified in a safer way
           than on the command line even when --no-defaults is used. To create
           .mylogin.cnf, use the mysql_config_editor utility. See
           mysql_config_editor(1).

           For additional information about this and other option-file
           options, see Section 4.2.2.3, "Command-Line Options that Affect
           Option-File Handling".

       o   --password[=password], -p[password] The password of the MySQL
           account used for connecting to the server. The password value is
           optional. If not given, mysqladmin prompts for one. If given, there
           must be no space between --password= or -p and the password
           following it. If no password option is specified, the default is to
           send no password.

           Specifying a password on the command line should be considered
           insecure. To avoid giving the password on the command line, use an
           option file. See Section 6.1.2.1, "End-User Guidelines for Password
           Security".

           To explicitly specify that there is no password and that mysqladmin
           should not prompt for one, use the --skip-password option.

       o   --password1[=pass_val] The password for multifactor authentication
           factor 1 of the MySQL account used for connecting to the server.
           The password value is optional. If not given, mysql prompts for
           one. If given, there must be no space between --password1= and the
           password following it. If no password option is specified, the
           default is to send no password.

           Specifying a password on the command line should be considered
           insecure. To avoid giving the password on the command line, use an
           option file. See Section 6.1.2.1, "End-User Guidelines for Password
           Security".

           To explicitly specify that there is no password and that mysqladmin
           should not prompt for one, use the --skip-password1 option.

           --password1 and --password are synonymous, as are --skip-password1
           and --skip-password.

       o   --password2[=pass_val] The password for multifactor authentication
           factor 2 of the MySQL account used for connecting to the server.
           The semantics of this option are similar to the semantics for
           --password1; see the description of that option for details.

       o   --password3[=pass_val] The password for multifactor authentication
           factor 3 of the MySQL account used for connecting to the server.
           The semantics of this option are similar to the semantics for
           --password1; see the description of that option for details.

       o   --pipe, -W On Windows, connect to the server using a named pipe.
           This option applies only if the server was started with the
           named_pipe system variable enabled to support named-pipe
           connections. In addition, the user making the connection must be a
           member of the Windows group specified by the
           named_pipe_full_access_group system variable.

       o   --plugin-dir=dir_name The directory in which to look for plugins.
           Specify this option if the --default-auth option is used to specify
           an authentication plugin but mysqladmin does not find it. See
           Section 6.2.17, "Pluggable Authentication".

       o   --port=port_num, -P port_num For TCP/IP connections, the port
           number to use.

       o   --print-defaults Print the program name and all options that it
           gets from option files.

           For additional information about this and other option-file
           options, see Section 4.2.2.3, "Command-Line Options that Affect
           Option-File Handling".

       o   --protocol={TCP|SOCKET|PIPE|MEMORY} The transport protocol to use
           for connecting to the server. It is useful when the other
           connection parameters normally result in use of a protocol other
           than the one you want. For details on the permissible values, see
           Section 4.2.7, "Connection Transport Protocols".

       o   --relative, -r Show the difference between the current and previous
           values when used with the --sleep option. This option works only
           with the extended-status command.

       o   --server-public-key-path=file_name The path name to a file in PEM
           format containing a client-side copy of the public key required by
           the server for RSA key pair-based password exchange. This option
           applies to clients that authenticate with the sha256_password or
           caching_sha2_password authentication plugin. This option is ignored
           for accounts that do not authenticate with one of those plugins. It
           is also ignored if RSA-based password exchange is not used, as is
           the case when the client connects to the server using a secure
           connection.

           If --server-public-key-path=file_name is given and specifies a
           valid public key file, it takes precedence over
           --get-server-public-key.

           For sha256_password, this option applies only if MySQL was built
           using OpenSSL.

           For information about the sha256_password and caching_sha2_password
           plugins, see Section 6.4.1.3, "SHA-256 Pluggable Authentication",
           and Section 6.4.1.2, "Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication".

       o   --shared-memory-base-name=name On Windows, the shared-memory name
           to use for connections made using shared memory to a local server.
           The default value is MYSQL. The shared-memory name is
           case-sensitive.

           This option applies only if the server was started with the
           shared_memory system variable enabled to support shared-memory
           connections.

       o   --show-warnings Show warnings resulting from execution of
           statements sent to the server.

       o   --shutdown-timeout=value The maximum number of seconds to wait for
           server shutdown. The default value is 3600 (1 hour).

       o   --silent, -s Exit silently if a connection to the server cannot be
           established.

       o   --sleep=delay, -i delay Execute commands repeatedly, sleeping for
           delay seconds in between. The --count option determines the number
           of iterations. If --count is not given, mysqladmin executes
           commands indefinitely until interrupted.

       o   --socket=path, -S path For connections to localhost, the Unix
           socket file to use, or, on Windows, the name of the named pipe to
           use.

           On Windows, this option applies only if the server was started with
           the named_pipe system variable enabled to support named-pipe
           connections. In addition, the user making the connection must be a
           member of the Windows group specified by the
           named_pipe_full_access_group system variable.

       o   --ssl* Options that begin with --ssl specify whether to connect to
           the server using encryption and indicate where to find SSL keys and
           certificates. See the section called "Command Options for Encrypted
           Connections".

       o   --ssl-fips-mode={OFF|ON|STRICT} Controls whether to enable FIPS
           mode on the client side. The --ssl-fips-mode option differs from
           other --ssl-xxx options in that it is not used to establish
           encrypted connections, but rather to affect which cryptographic
           operations to permit. See Section 6.8, "FIPS Support".

           These --ssl-fips-mode values are permitted:

           o   OFF: Disable FIPS mode.

           o   ON: Enable FIPS mode.

           o   STRICT: Enable "strict" FIPS mode.

               Note
               If the OpenSSL FIPS Object Module is not available, the only
               permitted value for --ssl-fips-mode is OFF. In this case,
               setting --ssl-fips-mode to ON or STRICT causes the client to
               produce a warning at startup and to operate in non-FIPS mode.
           As of MySQL 8.0.34, this option is deprecated. Expect it to be
           removed in a future version of MySQL.

       o   --tls-ciphersuites=ciphersuite_list The permissible ciphersuites
           for encrypted connections that use TLSv1.3. The value is a list of
           one or more colon-separated ciphersuite names. The ciphersuites
           that can be named for this option depend on the SSL library used to
           compile MySQL. For details, see Section 6.3.2, "Encrypted
           Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers".

           This option was added in MySQL 8.0.16.

       o   --tls-version=protocol_list The permissible TLS protocols for
           encrypted connections. The value is a list of one or more
           comma-separated protocol names. The protocols that can be named for
           this option depend on the SSL library used to compile MySQL. For
           details, see Section 6.3.2, "Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and
           Ciphers".

       o   --user=user_name, -u user_name The user name of the MySQL account
           to use for connecting to the server.

           If you are using the Rewriter plugin with MySQL 8.0.31 or later,
           you should grant this user the SKIP_QUERY_REWRITE privilege.

       o   --verbose, -v Verbose mode. Print more information about what the
           program does.

       o   --version, -V Display version information and exit.

       o   --vertical, -E Print output vertically. This is similar to
           --relative, but prints output vertically.

       o   --wait[=count], -w[count] If the connection cannot be established,
           wait and retry instead of aborting. If a count value is given, it
           indicates the number of times to retry. The default is one time.

       o   --zstd-compression-level=level The compression level to use for
           connections to the server that use the zstd compression algorithm.
           The permitted levels are from 1 to 22, with larger values
           indicating increasing levels of compression. The default zstd
           compression level is 3. The compression level setting has no effect
           on connections that do not use zstd compression.

           For more information, see Section 4.2.8, "Connection Compression
           Control".

           This option was added in MySQL 8.0.18.
