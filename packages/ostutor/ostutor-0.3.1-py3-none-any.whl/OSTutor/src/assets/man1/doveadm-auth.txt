NAME
       doveadm-auth - Flush/lookup/test authentication data

SYNOPSIS
       doveadm [-Dv] [-f formatter] auth command [OPTIONS] [ARGUMENTS]

DESCRIPTION
       The  doveadm   auth COMMANDS can be used to perform various authentica-
       tion related actions.

OPTIONS
       Global doveadm(1) options:

       -D     Enables verbosity and debug messages.

       -f formatter
              Specifies the formatter for formatting  the  output.   Supported
              formatters are:

              flow   prints each line with key=value pairs.

              pager  prints each key: value pair on its own line and separates
                     records with form feed character (^L).

              tab    prints a table header followed  by  tab  separated  value
                     lines.

              table  prints a table header followed by adjusted value lines.

       -o setting=value
              Overrides  the  configuration  setting  from  /etc/dovecot/dove-
              cot.conf and from the userdb with the given value.  In order  to
              override  multiple settings, the -o option may be specified mul-
              tiple times.

       -v     Enables verbosity, including progress counter.

       Command specific options:

       -x auth_info
              auth_info specifies additional conditions for  the  auth  lookup
              and  auth  test commands.  The auth_info option string has to be
              given as name=value pair.  For multiple conditions the -x option
              could be supplied multiple times.
              Possible names for the auth_info are:

              service
                     The service for which the authentication lookup should be
                     tested.  The value may be the name of a service, commonly
                     used with Dovecot.  For example: imap, pop3 or smtp.

              lip    The local IP address (server) for the test.

              rip    The remote IP address (client) for the test.

              lport  The local port, e.g. 143

              rport  The remote port, e.g. 24567

ARGUMENTS
       user   The  user's login name.  Depending on the configuration, the lo-
              gin name may be for example jane or john@example.com.

       password
              Optionally the user's password.  doveadm(1) will prompt for  the
              password, if none was given.

COMMANDS
   auth cache flush
       doveadm auth cache flush [-a master_socket_path] [user ...]

       Flush  the  authentication  cache.  By default the cache is flushed for
       all the users (which can also be done by sending  SIGHUP  to  the  auth
       process).   You  can also flush the cache for one or more users by pro-
       viding their usernames.

       -a master_socket_path
              This option is used to specify an absolute path to  an  alterna-
              tive UNIX domain socket.

              By   default  doveadm(1)  will  use  the  socket  /var/run/dove-
              cot/auth-master.  The socket may be located  in  another  direc-
              tory,  when  the  default  base_dir  setting  was  overridden in
              /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf.

   auth lookup
       doveadm  auth  lookup  [-a  userdb_socket_path]  [-x   auth_info]   [-f
       field] user [...]

       Similar  to doveadm-user(1) command, except it performs a passdb lookup
       (without authentication) instead of a userdb lookup.

       -a userdb_socket_path
              This option is used to specify an absolute path to  an  alterna-
              tive UNIX domain socket.

              By   default  doveadm(1)  will  use  the  socket  /var/run/dove-
              cot/auth-userdb.  The socket may be located  in  another  direc-
              tory,  when  the  default  base_dir  setting  was  overridden in
              /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf.

       -f field
              When this option and the  name  of  a  userdb  field  is  given,
              doveadm(1) will show only the value of the specified field.

   auth test
       doveadm auth test [-a auth_socket_path] [-x auth_info] user [password]

       Test authentication for the given user.

       -a auth_socket_path
              This  option  is used to specify an absolute path to an alterna-
              tive UNIX domain socket.

              By  default  doveadm(1)  will  use  the  socket   /var/run/dove-
              cot/auth-client.   The  socket  may be located in another direc-
              tory, when  the  default  base_dir  setting  was  overridden  in
              /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf.

EXAMPLE
       This  example  demonstrates  an imap authentication test for user john,
       assuming the user is connected  from  the  host  with  the  IP  address
       192.0.2.143.

       doveadm auth test -x service=imap -x rip=192.0.2.143 john
       Password:
       passdb: john auth succeeded
       extra fields:
         user=john
