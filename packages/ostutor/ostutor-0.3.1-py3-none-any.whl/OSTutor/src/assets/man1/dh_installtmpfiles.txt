NAME
       dh_installtmpfiles - install tmpfiles.d configuration files

SYNOPSIS
       dh_installtmpfiles [debhelperoptions][--name=name]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_installtmpfiles is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       installing package maintainer supplied tmpfiles.d configuration files
       (e.g. for systemd-tmpfiles).

       It also finds the tmpfiles.d configuration files installed by a package
       and generates postinst code blocks for activting the tmpfiles.d
       configuration when the package is installed. These snippets are added
       to the maintainer scripts by dh_installdeb(1).

OPTIONS
           This option controls both a prefix used for lookng up maintainer
           provided tmpfiles.d configuration files (those mentioned in the
           "FILES" section) and also the base name used for the installed
           version of the file.

FILES
       debian/package.tmpfiles
           If this exists, it is installed into usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/ in the
           package build directory. Note that the "tmpfiles.d" mechanism is
           currently only used by systemd.

       debian/package.tmpfile
           Deprecated name for debian/package.tmpfiles.

NOTES
       This command is not idempotent. dh_prep(1) should be called between
       invocations of this command (with the same arguments). Otherwise, it
       may cause multiple instances of the same text to be added to maintainer
       scripts.
