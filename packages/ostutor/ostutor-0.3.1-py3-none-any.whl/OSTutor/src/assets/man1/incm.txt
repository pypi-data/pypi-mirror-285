NAME
       incm - Incorporating new mails for Mew

SYNOPSIS
       incm [options]

DESCRIPTION
       The incm utility incorporates new mails from the mbox or the maildir to
       Mew's inbox folder.

       The options are as follows:

       -a      Retrieve all mails from maildir/{cur,new} for maildir.

       -b      Backup mails.   mbox:  No  truncate  mbox  file.   maildir:  To
               maildir/cur directory.

       -c      Use  the Content-Length: field, instead of the "From " line, as
               a mail separator for mbox.

       -d path Path to mbox/maildir.  If path is a file, mbox is  assumed.  If
               path is a directory, maildir is assumed.

       -m path The same as the -d option.

       -s      Read one mail from stdin instead of mbox/maildir.

       -i inboxdir
               A path to the inbox directory.

       -u      Don't touch ".mew-mtime".

       -f      Preserve Unix From (Envelope Sender) line in mbox case.

       -p mode Specify file mode that creates in mbox case.

       -o      Use the suffix when creating messages.

       -x suffix
               Use this suffix.

       -h      Display this help message.

       -v      Display the version.

   mbox
       For mbox, the mail separator is "From " in the beginning of lines.  The
       incm utility does not convert ">From " to "From " in the  beginning  of
       lines in the body.  On Solaris, Content-Length: should be used with the
       -c option to tell the end of mail.

       To lock mbox, a  lock  file("<user>.lock"),  flock()  or  lockf(),  and
       open(O_EXLOCK) are used.

   maildir
       For maildir, no lock and no separator are necessary.

       Consider the following situation:
               cur/{1,2}
               new/{3,4}

       Executing incm without the options results in:
               cur/{1,2}
               new/{}
               to inbox: {3,4}

       Executing incm with the -a option results in:
               cur/{}
               new/{}
               to inbox: {1,2,3,4}

       Executing incm with the -b option results in:
               cur/{1,2,3,4}
               new/{}
               to inbox: {3,4}

       Executing incm with the -a option and the -b option results in:
               cur/{1,2,3,4}
               new/{}
               to inbox: {1,2,3,4}
       So,  if  both  options  are  specified, messages are retrieved multiple
       times.
