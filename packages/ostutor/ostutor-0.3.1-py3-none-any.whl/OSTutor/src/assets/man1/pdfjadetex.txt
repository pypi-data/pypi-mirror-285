NAME
       pdfjadetex - PDF output from JadeTeX

SYNOPSIS
       pdfjadetex [options] [commands]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page was derived from the manual page for pdfTeX and is not
       meant to be exhaustive.  The complete documentation for this version of
       TeX  can  be  found in the info file or manual Web2C: A TeX implementa-
       tion.

       pdfjadeTeX is a version of TeX that can create PDF files as well as DVI
       files.

       The  typical use of pdfjadeTeX is with a pregenerated formats for which
       PDF output has been enabled.  The pdfjadetex command uses  the  equiva-
       lent of the plain JadeTeX format.

       pdfjadeTeX's  handling of its command-line arguments is similar to that
       of LaTeX.

OPTIONS
       This version of pdfjadeTeX understands the following command  line  op-
       tions.

       --fmt format
              Use  format as the name of the format to be used, instead of the
              name by which pdfjadeTeX was called or a %& line.

       --help Print help message and exit.

       --ini  Be pdfinitex, for dumping formats; this is  implicitly  true  if
              the program is called as pdfinitex.

       --interaction mode
              Sets  the  interaction  mode.  The mode can be one of batchmode,
              nonstopmode, scrollmode,  and  errorstopmode.   The  meaning  of
              these modes is the same as that of the corresponding \commands.

       --ipc  Send  DVI  or PDF output to a socket as well as the usual output
              file.  Whether this option is available is the choice of the in-
              staller.

       --ipc-start
              As  --ipc,  and  starts  the  server  at  the other end as well.
              Whether this option is available is the choice of the installer.

       --kpathsea-debug bitmask
              Sets path searching debugging flags according  to  the  bitmask.
              See the Kpathsea manual for details.

       --maketex fmt
              Enable mktexfmt, where fmt must be one of tex or tfm.

       --no-maketex fmt
              Disable mktexfmt, where fmt must be one of tex or tfm.

       --output-comment string
              Use string for the DVI file comment instead of the date.

       --progname name
              Pretend  to  be program name.  This affects both the format used
              and the search paths.

       --shell-escape
              Enable the \write18{command} construct.  The command can be  any
              Bourne shell command.  This construct is normally disallowed for
              security reasons.

       --version
              Print version information and exit.

ENVIRONMENT
       See the Kpathsearch library documentation  (the  `Path  specifications'
       node)  for  precise  details of how the environment variables are used.
       The kpsewhich utility can be used to query the values of the variables.

       One caveat: In most pdfjadeTeX formats, you cannot use ~ in a  filename
       you  give directly to pdfjadeTeX, because ~ is an active character, and
       hence is expanded, not taken as part of the filename.  Other  programs,
       such as Metafont, do not have this problem.

       TEXMFOUTPUT
              Normally, pdfjadeTeX puts its output files in the current direc-
              tory.  If any output file cannot be opened there,  it  tries  to
              open  it  in the directory specified in the environment variable
              TEXMFOUTPUT.  There is no default value for that variable.   For
              example,  if  you say tex paper and the current directory is not
              writable, if TEXMFOUTPUT has the value /tmp, pdfjadeTeX attempts
              to  create  /tmp/paper.log (and /tmp/paper.pdf, if any output is
              produced.)

       TEXINPUTS
              Search path for \input and \openin files.  This should  probably
              start  with  ``.'',  so  that user files are found before system
              files.

       TEXFONTS
              Search path for font metric (.tfm) files.

       TEXFORMATS
              Search path for format files.

       TEXPOOL
              search path for pdfinitex internal strings.

       TEXEDIT
              Command template for switching to editor.  The default,  usually
              vi, is set when pdfjadeTeX is compiled.

FILES
       The location of the files mentioned below varies from system to system.
       Use the kpsewhich utility to find their locations.

       pdfjadetex.pool
              Encoded text of pdfjadeTeX's messages.

       texfonts.map
              Filename mapping definitions.

       *.tfm  Metric files for pdfjadeTeX's fonts.

       *.fmt  Predigested pdfjadeTeX format (.fmt) files.

BUGS
       This version of pdfjadeTeX fails to trap arithmetic overflow  when  di-
       mensions  are  added  or subtracted.  Cases where this occurs are rare,
       but when it does the generated DVI file will be invalid.
