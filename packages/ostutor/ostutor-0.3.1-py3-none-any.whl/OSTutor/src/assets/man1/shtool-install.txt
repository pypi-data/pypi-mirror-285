NAME
       shtool-install - GNU shtool install(1) command

SYNOPSIS
       shtool install [-v|--verbose] [-t|--trace] [-d|--mkdir] [-c|--copy]
       [-C|--compare-copy] [-s|--strip] [-m|--mode mode] [-o|--owner owner]
       [-g|--group group] [-e|--exec sed-cmd] file [file ...]  path

DESCRIPTION
       This command installs a one or more files to a given target path
       providing all important options of the BSD install(1) command.  The
       trick is that the functionality is provided in a portable way.

OPTIONS
       The following command line options are available.

       -v, --verbose
           Display some processing information.

       -t, --trace
           Enable the output of the essential shell commands which are
           executed.

       -d, --mkdir
           To maximize BSD compatibility, the BSD "shtool "install -d"" usage
           is internally mapped to the "shtool "mkdir -f -p -m 755"" command.

       -c, --copy
           Copy the file to the target path. Default is to move.

       -C, --compare-copy
           Same as -c except if the destination file already exists and is
           identical to the source file, no installation is done and the
           target remains untouched.

       -s, --strip
           This option strips program executables during the installation, see
           strip(1). Default is to install verbatim.

       -m, --mode mode
           The file mode applied to the target, see chmod(1). Setting mode to
           ""-"" skips this step and leaves the operating system default which
           is usually based on umask(1). Some file modes require superuser
           privileges to be set. Default is 0755.

       -o, --owner owner
           The file owner name or id applied to the target, see chown(1). This
           option requires superuser privileges to execute. Default is to skip
           this step and leave the operating system default which is usually
           based on the executing uid or the parent setuid directory.

       -g, --group group
           The file group name or id applied to the target, see chgrp(1). This
           option requires superuser privileges to execute to the fullest
           extend, otherwise the choice of group is limited on most operating
           systems.  Default is to skip this step and leave the operating
           system default which is usually based on the executing gid or the
           parent setgid directory.

       -e, --exec sed-cmd
           This option can be used one or multiple times to apply one or more
           sed(1) commands to the file contents during installation.

EXAMPLE
        #   Makefile
        install:
             :
            shtool install -c -s -m 4755 foo $(bindir)/
            shtool install -c -m 644 foo.man $(mandir)/man1/foo.1
            shtool install -c -m 644 -e "s/@p@/$prefix/g" foo.conf $(etcdir)/

HISTORY
       The GNU shtool install command was originally written by Ralf S.
       Engelschall <rse@engelschall.com> in 1997 for GNU shtool. It was
       prompted by portability issues in the installation procedures of OSSP
       libraries.
