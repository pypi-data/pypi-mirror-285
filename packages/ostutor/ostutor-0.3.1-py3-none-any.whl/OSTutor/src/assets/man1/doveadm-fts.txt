NAME
       doveadm-fts - Manipulate the Full Text Search (FTS) index

SYNOPSIS
       doveadm [-Dv] fts command [OPTIONS] [ARGUMENTS]

DESCRIPTION
       The doveadm fts COMMANDS can be used to manipulate the Full Text Search
       (FTS) index.

OPTIONS
       Global doveadm(1) options:

       -D     Enables verbosity and debug messages.

       -o setting=value
              Overrides  the  configuration  setting  from  /etc/dovecot/dove-
              cot.conf  and from the userdb with the given value.  In order to
              override multiple settings, the -o option may be specified  mul-
              tiple times.

       -v     Enables verbosity, including progress counter.

       This  command  uses  by  default the output formatter flow (without the
       key= prefix).

       Command specific options:

       -A     If the -A option is present, the command will be  performed  for
              all  users.   Using this option in combination with system users
              from userdb { driver = passwd } is not recommended,  because  it
              contains  also  users  with  a lower UID than the one configured
              with the first_valid_uid setting.

              When the SQL userdb module is used  make  sure  that  the  iter-
              ate_query  setting  in /etc/dovecot/dovecot-sql.conf.ext matches
              your database layout.  When using the LDAP userdb  module,  make
              sure  that  the  iterate_attrs  and  iterate_filter  settings in
              /etc/dovecot/dovecot-ldap.conf.ext match your LDAP schema.  Oth-
              erwise doveadm(1) will be unable to iterate over all users.

       -F file
              Execute the command for all the users in the file.  This is sim-
              ilar to the -A option, but instead of getting the list of  users
              from  the  userdb,  they are read from the given file.  The file
              contains one username per line.

       -S socket_path
              The option's argument is either an absolute path to a local UNIX
              domain  socket, or a hostname and port (hostname:port), in order
              to connect a remote host via a TCP socket.

              This allows an administrator to execute doveadm(1) mail commands
              through the given socket.

       -u user/mask
              Run  the command only for the given user.  It's also possible to
              use '*' and '?' wildcards (e.g. -u *@example.org).
              When neither the -A option, nor  the  -F file  option,  nor  the
              -u user was specified, the command will be executed with the en-
              vironment of the currently logged in user.

ARGUMENTS
       namespace
              The name of a namespace, e.g. the name of the shared  namespace.
              When  no  namespace was given, the user's private namespace will
              be used.

COMMANDS
   fts optimize
       doveadm fts optimize [-u user|-A|-F file] [-S socket_path] [namespace]

       Optimize the full text search index.  This is also  done  automatically
       by the full text search engines, but this enforces it to happen.

   fts rescan
       doveadm fts rescan [-u user|-A|-F file] [-S socket_path] [namespace]

       Scan  what  mails exist in the full text search index and compare those
       to what actually exist in mailboxes.  This removes mails from the index
       that  have  already  been expunged and makes sure that the next doveadm
       index will index all the missing mails (if any).
