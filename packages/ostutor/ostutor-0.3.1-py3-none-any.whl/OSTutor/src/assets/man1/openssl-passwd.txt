NAME
       openssl-passwd, passwd - compute password hashes

SYNOPSIS
       openssl passwd [-help] [-crypt] [-1] [-apr1] [-aixmd5] [-5] [-6] [-salt
       string] [-in file] [-stdin] [-noverify] [-quiet] [-table] [-rand
       file...]  [-writerand file] {password}

DESCRIPTION
       The passwd command computes the hash of a password typed at run-time or
       the hash of each password in a list.  The password list is taken from
       the named file for option -in file, from stdin for option -stdin, or
       from the command line, or from the terminal otherwise.  The Unix
       standard algorithm crypt and the MD5-based BSD password algorithm 1,
       its Apache variant apr1, and its AIX variant are available.

OPTIONS
       -help
           Print out a usage message.

       -crypt
           Use the crypt algorithm (default).

       -1  Use the MD5 based BSD password algorithm 1.

       -apr1
           Use the apr1 algorithm (Apache variant of the BSD algorithm).

       -aixmd5
           Use the AIX MD5 algorithm (AIX variant of the BSD algorithm).

       -5
       -6  Use the SHA256 / SHA512 based algorithms defined by Ulrich Drepper.
           See <https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/SHA-crypt.txt>.

       -salt string
           Use the specified salt.  When reading a password from the terminal,
           this implies -noverify.

       -in file
           Read passwords from file.

       -stdin
           Read passwords from stdin.

       -noverify
           Don't verify when reading a password from the terminal.

       -quiet
           Don't output warnings when passwords given at the command line are
           truncated.

       -table
           In the output list, prepend the cleartext password and a TAB
           character to each password hash.

       -rand file...
           A file or files containing random data used to seed the random
           number generator.  Multiple files can be specified separated by an
           OS-dependent character.  The separator is ; for MS-Windows, , for
           OpenVMS, and : for all others.

       [-writerand file]
           Writes random data to the specified file upon exit.  This can be
           used with a subsequent -rand flag.

EXAMPLES
         % openssl passwd -crypt -salt xx password
         xxj31ZMTZzkVA

         % openssl passwd -1 -salt xxxxxxxx password
         $1$xxxxxxxx$UYCIxa628.9qXjpQCjM4a.

         % openssl passwd -apr1 -salt xxxxxxxx password
         $apr1$xxxxxxxx$dxHfLAsjHkDRmG83UXe8K0

         % openssl passwd -aixmd5 -salt xxxxxxxx password
         xxxxxxxx$8Oaipk/GPKhC64w/YVeFD/
