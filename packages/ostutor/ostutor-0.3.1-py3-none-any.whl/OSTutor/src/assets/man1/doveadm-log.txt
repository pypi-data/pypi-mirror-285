DESCRIPTION
       The doveadm log commands are used to locate and reopen the log files of
       dovecot(1).  It's also possible to test the configured targets  of  the
       *log_path settings.

OPTIONS
       Global doveadm(1) options:

       -D     Enables verbosity and debug messages.

       -o setting=value
              Overrides  the  configuration  setting  from  /etc/dovecot/dove-
              cot.conf and from the userdb with the given value.  In order  to
              override  multiple settings, the -o option may be specified mul-
              tiple times.

       -v     Enables verbosity, including progress counter.

COMMANDS
   log errors
       doveadm log errors [-s min_timestamp]

       The log errors command is used to show the last  - up to 1,000 - errors
       and warnings.  If no output is generated, no errors have occurred since
       the last start.

       -s min_timestamp
              An integer value, representing seconds since the  epoch  -  also
              known  as  Unix  timestamp.   When  a  min_timestamp  was given,
              doveadm(1) will only show errors occurred since  that  point  in
              time.

   log find
       doveadm log find [directory]

       The  log find command is used to show the location of the log files, to
       which dovecot(1) sends its log messages.  If dovecot(1) logs  its  mes-
       sages  through  syslogd(8) and doveadm(1) could not find any log files,
       you can specify the directory where your syslogd writes its log files.

   log reopen
       doveadm log reopen

       This command causes doveadm to reopen all log files, configured in  the
       log_path,  info_log_path  and  debug_log_path settings.  These settings
       are configured in /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-logging.conf.
       This is for example useful after manually rotating the log files.

   log test
       doveadm log test

       This command causes doveadm to write the  message  "This  is  Dovecot's
       priority log (timestamp)" to the configured log files.  The used prior-
       ities are: debug, info, warning, error and fatal.

EXAMPLE
       This example shows how to locate the log files used by dovecot(1).

       Debug: /var/log/dovecot.debug

       Error: /var/log/mail.log
