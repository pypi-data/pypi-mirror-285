NAME
       mysqldumpslow - Summarize slow query log files

SYNOPSIS
       mysqldumpslow [options] [log_file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       The MySQL slow query log contains information about queries that take a
       long time to execute (see Section 5.4.5, "The Slow Query Log").
       mysqldumpslow parses MySQL slow query log files and summarizes their
       contents.

       Normally, mysqldumpslow groups queries that are similar except for the
       particular values of number and string data values. It "abstracts"
       these values to N and 'S' when displaying summary output. To modify
       value abstracting behavior, use the -a and -n options.

       Invoke mysqldumpslow like this:

           mysqldumpslow [options] [log_file ...]

       Example output with no options given:

           Reading mysql slow query log from /usr/local/mysql/data/mysqld80-slow.log
           Count: 1  Time=4.32s (4s)  Lock=0.00s (0s)  Rows=0.0 (0), root[root]@localhost
            insert into t2 select * from t1
           Count: 3  Time=2.53s (7s)  Lock=0.00s (0s)  Rows=0.0 (0), root[root]@localhost
            insert into t2 select * from t1 limit N
           Count: 3  Time=2.13s (6s)  Lock=0.00s (0s)  Rows=0.0 (0), root[root]@localhost
            insert into t1 select * from t1

       mysqldumpslow supports the following options.

       o   --help Display a help message and exit.

       o   -a

           Do not abstract all numbers to N and strings to 'S'.

       o   --debug, -d Run in debug mode.

           This option is available only if MySQL was built using WITH_DEBUG.
           MySQL release binaries provided by Oracle are not built using this
           option.

       o   -g pattern

           Consider only queries that match the (grep-style) pattern.

       o   -h host_name

           Host name of MySQL server for *-slow.log file name. The value can
           contain a wildcard. The default is * (match all).

       o   -i name

           Name of server instance (if using mysql.server startup script).

       o   -l

           Do not subtract lock time from total time.

       o   -n N

           Abstract numbers with at least N digits within names.

       o   -r

           Reverse the sort order.

       o   -s sort_type

           How to sort the output. The value of sort_type should be chosen
           from the following list:

           o   t, at: Sort by query time or average query time

           o   l, al: Sort by lock time or average lock time

           o   r, ar: Sort by rows sent or average rows sent

           o   c: Sort by count

           By default, mysqldumpslow sorts by average query time (equivalent
           to -s at).

       o   -t N

           Display only the first N queries in the output.

       o   --verbose, -v Verbose mode. Print more information about what the
           program does.
