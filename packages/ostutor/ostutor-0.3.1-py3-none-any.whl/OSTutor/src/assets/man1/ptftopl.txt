NAME
       ptftopl,  uptftopl  -  Convert Japanese pTeX font metric (JFM) files to
       propery list

SYNOPSIS
       ptftopl [OPTIONS] tfm_name[.tfm] [pl_name[.pl]]

DESCRIPTION
       The ptftopl program translates a Japanese pTeX font metric  (JFM)  file
       to  a  Japanese property list (JPL) file.  It also serves as a TFM/JFM-
       file validating program.

       The uptftopl program is a Unicode-enabled version of ptftopl.

       In the following sections, we refer to these programs as (u)ptftopl.

       (u)ptftopl is upper compatible with tftopl; if the input  TFM  file  is
       for  roman fonts, it is translated into an ordinary property list file.
       The difference between ptftopl and uptftopl lies in the internal encod-
       ing:  when  the input is a JFM file, ptftopl always treats it as a JIS-
       encoded JFM; on the other hand, uptftopl treats it as a Unicode-encoded
       JFM by default.

OPTIONS
       Compared to tftopl, the following option is added to (u)ptftopl.

       -kanji string
              Sets  the  output Japanese Kanji code.  The string can be one of
              the      followings:      euc (EUC-JP),       jis (ISO-2022-JP),
              sjis (Shift_JIS), utf8 (UTF-8), uptex (UTF-8; uptftopl only).

       When  one  of euc, jis, sjis or utf8 is specified, both ptftopl and up-
       tftopl treats the input JFM as JIS-encoded.  When  uptex  is  specified
       with uptftopl, it treats the input JFM as Unicode-encoded.
