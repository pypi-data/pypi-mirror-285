NAME
       mkhtmlindex - generate index files for HTML man pages

SYNOPSIS
       mkhtmlindex htmlmandir

DESCRIPTION
       The  mkhtmlindex program generates index files for a directory of HTML-
       formatted manual pages.  It searches for files whose names are  of  the
       form  "name.1.html",  and outputs index files "manindex1.html", "manin-
       dex.2.html", and so on, one for each manual volume.  Empty index  files
       will  be  removed.   Names  and  descriptions are found by scanning the
       first <H2> section of each page.

OPTIONS
       mkhtmlindex takes only one argument: the directory to process.

NOTES
       This utility is currently rather specific to X manual pages.   In  par-
       ticular,  the format of the index files it outputs is not configurable,
       nor is the HTML formatting it expects of manual pages.
