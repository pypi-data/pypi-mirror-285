NAME
       doveadm-director - Manage Dovecot directors

SYNOPSIS
       doveadm [-Dv] [-f formatter] director command [OPTIONS] [ARGUMENTS]

DESCRIPTION
       doveadm director can be used to manage and query the status of the list
       of backend mail servers where Dovecot proxy  can  redirect  connections
       to.

OPTIONS
       Global doveadm(1) options:

       -D     Enables verbosity and debug messages.

       -f formatter
              Specifies  the  formatter  for formatting the output.  Supported
              formatters are:

              flow   prints each line with key=value pairs.

              pager  prints each key: value pair on its own line and separates
                     records with form feed character (^L).

              tab    prints  a  table  header  followed by tab separated value
                     lines.

              table  prints a table header followed by adjusted value lines.

       -o setting=value
              Overrides  the  configuration  setting  from  /etc/dovecot/dove-
              cot.conf  and from the userdb with the given value.  In order to
              override multiple settings, the -o option may be specified  mul-
              tiple times.

       -v     Enables verbosity, including progress counter.

       Command specific options:

       -a director_socket_path
              This  option  is used to specify an alternative socket.  The op-
              tion's argument is either an absolute path to a local  UNIX  do-
              main socket, or a hostname and port (hostname:port), in order to
              connect a remote host via a TCP socket.

              By default doveadm(1) will use the  socket  /var/run/dovecot/di-
              rector-admin.   The  socket may be located in another directory,
              when the default base_dir setting was overridden  in  /etc/dove-
              cot/dovecot.conf.

ARGUMENTS
       host   A mail server's hostname or IP address.

       ip     A director's IP address.

       port   The TCP port, on which the director server is listening for con-
              nections.  The default port is the same as what the local direc-
              tor is listening in.

       user   Is a user's login name.  Depending on the configuration, a login
              name may be for example jane or john@example.com.

       vhost_count
              The number of "virtual hosts" to  assign  to  this  server.  The
              higher the number is relative to other servers, the more connec-
              tions it gets. The default is 100.

COMMANDS
   director add
       doveadm director add [-a director_socket_path] host [vhost_count]

       The command's tasks are:

       *   assign a new mail server to the director.

       *   increase/decrease the vhost_count of an already assigned server.

   director dump
       doveadm director dump [-a director_socket_path]

       Dump the current host configuration as doveadm commands. These commands
       can  be easily run after a full director cluster restart to get back to
       the dumped state.

   director flush
       doveadm director flush [-a director_socket_path]  [-f]  [--max-parallel
       n] host|all

       doveadm  director  flush  removes all user associations either from the
       given host or all hosts. All the existing connections will  be  kicked.
       If director_flush_socket is specified, a flush script is also automati-
       cally executed.

       Because the kicking and moving of users to new backends creates a  tem-
       porary load spike, all the users aren't moved at once. The --max-paral-
       lel parameter specifies how many users can be moved concurrently.   The
       default is 100.

       If  -f parameter is used, the user associations are simply dropped. Ex-
       isting connections won't be kicked and flush scripts aren't run.

   director kick
       doveadm director kick [-a director_socket_path] user

       Kick the specified user from the entire Dovecot cluster.  This is simi-
       lar  to  doveadm proxy kick, but this command needs to be run only once
       instead of in each director server.

   director map
       doveadm director map [-a director_socket_path] [-f users_file]  [-h|-u]
       [host]

       The  command  doveadm director map is used to list current user -> host
       mappings. Note that the director works using 32bit hashes  which  makes
       collisions  quite  likely,  so this command can't reliably list exactly
       which users have recently logged in.

       -f users_file
              Path to a file containing all user names (one per  line).   When
              given no userdb lookup will be performed.  This may be a helpful
              alternative when for example the network connection to the  LDAP
              or SQL server is slow.

       -h     Output all usernames, which match the given hash.

       -u     Output hash for the given username.

       host   Specify a server's IP address or hostname, to list only mappings
              of the given host.

   director move
       doveadm director move [-a director_socket_path] user host

       Move the user to the specified backend host.  If the user has  any  ex-
       isting connections they will be killed.

   director remove
       doveadm director remove [-a director_socket_path] host

       Use this command in order to remove the given host from the director.

   director ring add
       doveadm director ring add [-a director_socket_path] ip [port]

       Add a new director to the ring.

   director ring remove
       doveadm director ring remove [-a director_socket_path] ip [port]

       Remove a director from the ring.

   director ring status
       doveadm director ring status [-a director_socket_path]

       Show the status of all the directors currently in the ring.

   director status
       doveadm director status [-a director_socket_path] [user]

       This  command  is  used  to show the current usage of all assigned mail
       servers.
       When a user name is given, this command shows which server the user  is
       currently  assigned  to, where the user will be assigned after the cur-
       rent saved assignment gets removed and where the user would be assigned
       to if the whole proxy cluster was restarted fresh.

FILES
       /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf
              Dovecot's main configuration file.

       /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-director.conf
              Director specific settings.

EXAMPLE
       Add  a  director  with  vhost count 150 (or change existing one's vhost
       count to 150):

       doveadm -v director add x1357.imap.ha.example.net 150
       2001:db8:543:6861:143::1357: OK

       Remove a director:

       doveadm director remove x1357.imap.ha.example.net

       Query the status of mail hosts in a director:

       doveadm director status
       mail server ip       vhosts  users
       192.168.10.1            100    125
       192.168.10.2            100    144
       192.168.10.3            100    115

       Query the status of a user's assignment:

       doveadm director status user@example.com
       Current: 192.168.10.1 (expires 2010-06-18 20:17:04)
       Hashed: 192.168.10.2
       Initial config: 192.168.10.3

       This means that the user is currently assigned to  mail  server  on  IP
       192.168.10.1.  After all of user's connections have logged out, the as-
       signment will be removed (currently it looks like at 20:17:04, but that
       may be increased). After the assignment has expired, the user will next
       time be redirected to 192.168.10.2 (assuming  no  changes  to  director
       settings).  If  the entire Dovecot proxy cluster was restarted, so that
       all of the director configuration would revert back to its initial val-
       ues, the user would be redirected to 192.168.10.3.
