NAME
       licensecheck - simple license checker for source files

VERSION
       Version v3.0.45

SYNOPSIS
       licensecheck --help|--version

       licensecheck [options...] path [path...]

DESCRIPTION
       licensecheck attempts to determine the license that applies to each
       file passed to it, by searching the start of the file for text
       belonging to various licenses.

       If any of the arguments passed are directories, licensecheck will add
       the files contained within to the list of files to process.

DEBUGGING
       If either of environment variables INFO, DEBUG or TRACE is set to true,
       varying details about discoveries are emitted to STDERR.
