NAME
       mysql_config - display options for compiling clients

SYNOPSIS
       mysql_config options

DESCRIPTION
       mysql_config provides you with useful information for compiling your
       MySQL client and connecting it to MySQL. It is a shell script, so it is
       available only on Unix and Unix-like systems.

           Note
           pkg-config can be used as an alternative to mysql_config for
           obtaining information such as compiler flags or link libraries
           required to compile MySQL applications. For more information, see
           Building C API Client Programs Using pkg-config[1].

       mysql_config supports the following options.

       o   --cflags C Compiler flags to find include files and critical
           compiler flags and defines used when compiling the libmysqlclient
           library. The options returned are tied to the specific compiler
           that was used when the library was created and might clash with the
           settings for your own compiler. Use --include for more portable
           options that contain only include paths.

       o   --cxxflags Like --cflags, but for C++ compiler flags.

       o   --include Compiler options to find MySQL include files.

       o   --libs Libraries and options required to link with the MySQL client
           library.

       o   --libs_r Libraries and options required to link with the
           thread-safe MySQL client library. In MySQL 8.0, all client
           libraries are thread-safe, so this option need not be used. The
           --libs option can be used in all cases.

       o   --plugindir The default plugin directory path name, defined when
           configuring MySQL.

       o   --port The default TCP/IP port number, defined when configuring
           MySQL.

       o   --socket The default Unix socket file, defined when configuring
           MySQL.

       o   --variable=var_name Display the value of the named configuration
           variable. Permitted var_name values are pkgincludedir (the header
           file directory), pkglibdir (the library directory), and plugindir
           (the plugin directory).

       o   --version Version number for the MySQL distribution.

       If you invoke mysql_config with no options, it displays a list of all
       options that it supports, and their values:

           $> mysql_config
           Usage: /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config [options]
           Options:
             --cflags         [-I/usr/local/mysql/include/mysql -mcpu=pentiumpro]
             --cxxflags       [-I/usr/local/mysql/include/mysql -mcpu=pentiumpro]
             --include        [-I/usr/local/mysql/include/mysql]
             --libs           [-L/usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql -lmysqlclient
                               -lpthread -lm -lrt -lssl -lcrypto -ldl]
             --libs_r         [-L/usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql -lmysqlclient_r
                               -lpthread -lm -lrt -lssl -lcrypto -ldl]
             --plugindir      [/usr/local/mysql/lib/plugin]
             --socket         [/tmp/mysql.sock]
             --port           [3306]
             --version        [5.8.0-m17]
             --variable=VAR   VAR is one of:
                     pkgincludedir [/usr/local/mysql/include]
                     pkglibdir     [/usr/local/mysql/lib]
                     plugindir     [/usr/local/mysql/lib/plugin]

       You can use mysql_config within a command line using backticks to
       include the output that it produces for particular options. For
       example, to compile and link a MySQL client program, use mysql_config
       as follows:

           gcc -c `mysql_config --cflags` progname.c
           gcc -o progname progname.o `mysql_config --libs`
