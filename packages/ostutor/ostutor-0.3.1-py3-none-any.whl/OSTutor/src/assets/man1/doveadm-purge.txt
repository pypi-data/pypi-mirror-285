NAME
       doveadm-purge - Remove messages with refcount=0 from mdbox files

SYNOPSIS
       doveadm [-Dv] purge [-S socket_path]
       doveadm [-Dv] purge [-S socket_path] -A
       doveadm [-Dv] purge [-S socket_path] -F file
       doveadm [-Dv] purge [-S socket_path] -u user

DESCRIPTION
       The  doveadm  purge  command  is  used to remove all messages with ref-
       count=0 from a user's mail storage.  The refcount of a message  is  de-
       creased  to  0  when  the user (or some administration utility) has ex-
       punged all instances of a message from all mailboxes.

       In the first form, doveadm(1) will perform the  purge  action  for  the
       currently logged in user.

       In the second form, the command will be executed for all users.

       In the third form, the command will be executed for all users listed in
       the given file.

       In the last form, only messages of the given user(s) will be purged.

OPTIONS
       Global doveadm(1) options:

       -D     Enables verbosity and debug messages.

       -o setting=value
              Overrides  the  configuration  setting  from  /etc/dovecot/dove-
              cot.conf  and from the userdb with the given value.  In order to
              override multiple settings, the -o option may be specified  mul-
              tiple times.

       -v     Enables verbosity, including progress counter.

       Command specific options:

       -A     If  the  -A option is present, the command will be performed for
              all users.  Using this option in combination with  system  users
              from  userdb  { driver = passwd } is not recommended, because it
              contains also users with a lower UID  than  the  one  configured
              with the first_valid_uid setting.

              When  the  SQL  userdb  module  is used make sure that the iter-
              ate_query setting in  /etc/dovecot/dovecot-sql.conf.ext  matches
              your  database  layout.  When using the LDAP userdb module, make
              sure that  the  iterate_attrs  and  iterate_filter  settings  in
              /etc/dovecot/dovecot-ldap.conf.ext match your LDAP schema.  Oth-
              erwise doveadm(1) will be unable to iterate over all users.

       -F file
              Execute the command for all the users in the file.  This is sim-
              ilar  to the -A option, but instead of getting the list of users
              from the userdb, they are read from the given  file.   The  file
              contains one username per line.

       -S socket_path
              The option's argument is either an absolute path to a local UNIX
              domain socket, or a hostname and port (hostname:port), in  order
              to connect a remote host via a TCP socket.

              This allows an administrator to execute doveadm(1) mail commands
              through the given socket.

       -u user/mask
              Run the command only for the given user.  It's also possible  to
              use '*' and '?' wildcards (e.g. -u *@example.org).
              When  neither  the  -A  option,  nor the -F file option, nor the
              -u user was specified, the command will be executed with the en-
              vironment of the currently logged in user.
