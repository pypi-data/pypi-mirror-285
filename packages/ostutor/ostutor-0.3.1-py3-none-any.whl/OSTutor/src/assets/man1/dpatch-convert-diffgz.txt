DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  documents briefly the dpatch-convert-diffgz command
       which simply generates a dpatch file from an existing  Debian  .diff.gz
       file.

       It does so, by building the sources with dpkg-buildpackage, and operat-
       ing on the resulting Debian .diff.gz.

WARNING
       dpatch is deprecated, please switch to the `3.0 (quilt)' Debian  source
       package   format   instead.   See  http://wiki.debian.org/Projects/Deb-
       Src3.0#FAQ for a short guide on how to do it.
