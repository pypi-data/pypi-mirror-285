NAME
       ltx2crossrefxml.pl - a tool for creation of XML files for submitting to
       crossref.

SYNOPSIS
       ltx2crossrefxml [-c config_file]  [-o output] latex_file latex_file ...

OPTIONS
       -c config_file
           Configuration file.  If this file is absent, some defaults are
           used.  See below for its format.

       -o output
           Output file.  If this option is not used, the XML is output to
           stdout.

DESCRIPTION
       The script takes a number of latex files and produces an XML file ready
       for submission to Crossref.  Each file must be previously processed by
       LaTeX with the newest "resphilosophica" package: the package creates
       the file ".rti" wtih the information about the bibliography.

       The processing of reference list is at present rather limited: only so
       called unstructured references are produced.

CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT
       The configuration file is mostly self-explanatory: it has comments
       (starting with "#") and assginments in the form

          $field = value ;

EXAMPLES
         ltx2crossrefxml.pl ../paper1/paper1.tex ../paper2/paper2.tex -o result.xml

         ltx2crossrefxml.pl -c myconfig.cnf paper.tex -o paper.xml
