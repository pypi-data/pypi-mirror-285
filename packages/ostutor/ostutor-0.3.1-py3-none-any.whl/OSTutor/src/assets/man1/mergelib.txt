NAME
       mergelib - merge one library into another

SYNOPSIS
       mergelib to-library from-library [object-filename-prefix]

DESCRIPTION
       The mergelib program merges objects from one library into another.  The
       names of object files in from-library will be prefixed by  object-file-
       name-prefix ("_" by default) to avoid name clashes.  The merged library
       will be left in to-library.
