NAME
       doveadm-proxy - Handle Dovecot proxy connections

SYNOPSIS
       doveadm [-Dv] [-f formatter] proxy command [OPTIONS] [ARGUMENTS]

DESCRIPTION
       The  doveadm  proxy  commands  are  used to list or kick active Dovecot
       proxy connections.

OPTIONS
       Global doveadm(1) options:

       -D     Enables verbosity and debug messages.

       -f formatter
              Specifies the formatter for formatting  the  output.   Supported
              formatters are:

              flow   prints each line with key=value pairs.

              pager  prints each key: value pair on its own line and separates
                     records with form feed character (^L).

              tab    prints a table header followed  by  tab  separated  value
                     lines.

              table  prints a table header followed by adjusted value lines.

       -o setting=value
              Overrides  the  configuration  setting  from  /etc/dovecot/dove-
              cot.conf and from the userdb with the given value.  In order  to
              override  multiple settings, the -o option may be specified mul-
              tiple times.

       -v     Enables verbosity, including progress counter.

       This command uses by default the table output formatter.

       Command specific options:

       -a ipc_socket_path
              This option is used to specify an alternative socket.   The  op-
              tion's  argument  is either an absolute path to a local UNIX do-
              main socket.

              By default doveadm(1) will use the socket  /var/run/dovecot/ipc.
              The socket may be located in another directory, when the default
              base_dir setting was overridden in /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf.

ARGUMENTS
       user   Is a user's login name.  Depending on the configuration, a login
              name  may  be  for  example jane or john@example.com.  It's also
              possible to use "*" and "?" wildcards (e.g. *@example.org).

COMMANDS
   proxy kick
       doveadm proxy kick [-a ipc_socket_path] user

       Kick all the connections being proxied for the given user.

   proxy list
