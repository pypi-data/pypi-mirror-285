NAME
       amstex - structured text formatting and typesetting

SYNOPSIS
       amstex [first-line]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual page is not meant to be exhaustive.  The complete documen-
       tation for this version of TeX can be found in the info file or  manual
       Web2C: A TeX implementation.

       The AmSTeX language is described in the book The Joy of TeX.  AmSTeX is
       a TeX macro package, not a modification to the TeX source  program,  so
       all the capabilities described in tex(1) are present.

       The AmSTeX macros encourage writers to think about the content of their
       documents, rather than the form.  The ideal, not always realized, is to
       have no formatting commands (like "switch to italic" or "skip 2 picas")
       in the document at all; instead, everything is done by specific  markup
       instructions: "emphasize", "start a section".

       For  authors  more familiar with LaTeX, an AMS-supported package called
       amsmath.sty is available, among others.
