NAME
       doveadm-dump - Dump the content of Dovecot's binary mailbox index/log

SYNOPSIS
       doveadm [-Dv] dump [-t type] path

DESCRIPTION
       Dovecot  uses  several  binary  index and log files in order to improve
       performance for accessing mails. For some mailbox formats, such as  sd-
       box  and mdbox, the index files are part of the format itself.  For de-
       tails about index files, see also: http://wiki2.dovecot.org/IndexFiles

       doveadm dump is used to show the contents of  those  mailbox  index/log
       files,  in human readable format. This is mainly useful for Dovecot de-
       velopers when debugging some problem.
