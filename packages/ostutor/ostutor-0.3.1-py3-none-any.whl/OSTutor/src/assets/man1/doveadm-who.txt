NAME
       doveadm-who - Show who is logged in to the Dovecot server

SYNOPSIS
       doveadm  [-Dv]  [-f  formatter]  who [-1] [-a anvil_socket_path] [user]
       [ip[/mask]]

DESCRIPTION
       The who command is used to show which users from which hosts  are  cur-
       rently connected to which service.

OPTIONS
       Global doveadm(1) options:

       -D     Enables verbosity and debug messages.

       -f formatter
              Specifies  the  formatter  for formatting the output.  Supported
              formatters are:

              flow   prints each line with key=value pairs.

              pager  prints each key: value pair on its own line and separates
                     records with form feed character (^L).

              tab    prints  a  table  header  followed by tab separated value
                     lines.

              table  prints a table header followed by adjusted value lines.

       -o setting=value
              Overrides  the  configuration  setting  from  /etc/dovecot/dove-
              cot.conf  and from the userdb with the given value.  In order to
              override multiple settings, the -o option may be specified  mul-
              tiple times.

       -v     Enables verbosity, including progress counter.

       This command uses by default the output formatter table.

       Command specific options:

       -1     Print  one  line per user and connection.  Otherwise the connec-
              tions are grouped by the username.

       -a anvil_socket_path
              This option is used to specify an alternative socket.   The  op-
              tion's  argument  is either an absolute path to a local UNIX do-
              main socket, or a hostname and port (hostname:port), in order to
              connect a remote host via a TCP socket.

              By   default  doveadm(1)  will  use  the  socket  /var/run/dove-
              cot/anvil.  The socket may be located in another directory, when
              the  default  base_dir  setting  was  overridden  in  /etc/dove-
              cot/dovecot.conf.

ARGUMENTS
       ip[/mask]
              Specify an ip address or network range, in CIDR notation, to re-
              duce the result to matching connections.

       user   List  only  users, whose name match user.  It's also possible to
              use wildcards in the user name.
