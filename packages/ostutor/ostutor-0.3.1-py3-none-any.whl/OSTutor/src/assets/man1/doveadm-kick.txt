NAME
       doveadm-kick - Disconnect users by user name and/or IP address

SYNOPSIS
       doveadm [-Dv] kick [ -a anvil_socket_path] [-f] user
       doveadm [-Dv] kick [ -a anvil_socket_path] [-f] ip[/mask]
       doveadm [-Dv] kick [ -a anvil_socket_path] [-f] user ip[/mask]

DESCRIPTION
       doveadm's kick  command is used to disconnect users by user name and/or
       the ip address, from which they are connected.

       In the first form, all users, whose login name matches the  user  argu-
       ment, will be disconnected.

       In  the  second form, all users, connected from the given IP address or
       network range, will be disconnected.

       In the last form, only users connected from the  given  IP  address  or
       networks range and a matching login name will be disconnected.

OPTIONS
       Global doveadm(1) options:

       -D     Enables verbosity and debug messages.

       -o setting=value
              Overrides  the  configuration  setting  from  /etc/dovecot/dove-
              cot.conf and from the userdb with the given value.  In order  to
              override  multiple settings, the -o option may be specified mul-
              tiple times.

       -v     Enables verbosity, including progress counter.

       Command specific options:

       -a anvil_socket_path
              This option is used to specify an absolute path to  an  alterna-
              tive UNIX domain socket.

              By   default  doveadm(1)  will  use  the  socket  /var/run/dove-
              cot/anvil.  The socket may be located in another directory, when
              the  default  base_dir  setting  was  overridden  in  /etc/dove-
              cot/dovecot.conf.

       -f     Enforce the disconnect, even when there are multiple users, from
              different  networks, connected to a single process.  This option
              may be only required when you have configured something like:

              service imap {
                ...
                client_limit = 1+n
                service_count = 0
                ...
              }

ARGUMENTS
       ip[/mask]
              ip or ip/mask is the host or network, from which the  users  are
              connected.

       user   Is a user's login name.  Depending on the configuration, a login
              name may be for example jane  or  john@example.com.   It's  also
              possible to use '*' and '?' wildcards (e.g. -u *@example.org).

EXAMPLE
       If  you don't want to disconnect all users at once, you can check who's
       currently logged in.  The first example demonstrates how to  disconnect
       all users whose login name is 3 characters long and begins with ba.

       doveadm who -1 ja*
       username                      proto pid  ip
       jane                          imap  8192 ::1
       james                         imap  8203 2001:db8:543:2::1
       doveadm kick ba?
       kicked connections from the following users:
       bar baz

       The  next  example  shows  how  to  kick  user  foo's  connections from
       192.0.2.*.

       doveadm who -1 foo
       username                     proto pid  ip
       foo                          imap  8135 fd95:4eed:38ba::25
       foo                          imap  9112 192.0.2.53
       foo                          imap  8216 192.0.2.111
       doveadm kick foo 192.0.2.0/24
       kicked connections from the following users:
       foo
       doveadm who f*
       username                  # proto (pids) (ips)
       foo                       1 imap  (8135) (fd95:4eed:38ba::25)
