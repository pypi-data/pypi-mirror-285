
bbl2bib(1)                     CROSSREF LIBRARY                     bbl2bib(1)

NAME
       bbl2bib.pl - convert thebibliography environment to a bib file

SYNOPSIS
       bbl2bib.pl [-d] [-u] [-o output] file

OPTIONS
       [-d]
           Send debugging output to stdout

       -o output
           Output file.  If this option is not used, the name for the output
           file is formed by changing the extension to ".bib"

       -u  Do not clean URL fields.

           Normally "bbl2bib" recognizes URL fields of the kind
           "http://dx.doi.org" and their variants and converts them to DOI
           fields (see also biburl2doi(1) script).  The switch -u suppresses
           this cleanup.

DESCRIPTION
       The script tries to reconstruct a "bib" file from the corresponding
       "thebibliography" environment.  One can argue that this operation is
       akin to reconstructing a cow from the steak.  The way the script does
       it is searching for the entry in the MR database, and creating the
       corresponding BibTeX fields.

       The script reads a TeX or Bbl file and extracts from it the
       "thebibliography" environment.  For each bibitem it creates a plain
       text bibliography entry, and then  tries to match it in the database.

INPUT FILE
       We assume some structure of the input file:

       1.  The bibliography is contained between the lines

              \begin{thebibliography}...

           and

              \end{thebibliography}

       2.  Each bibliography item starts from the line

              \bibitem[...]{....}

EXAMPLES
          bbl2bib  -o - file.tex > result.bib
          bbl2bib  -o result.bib file.bbl
          bbl2bib  file.tex
