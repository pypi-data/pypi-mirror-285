NAME
       pts-subscribe - time-limited subscription to the PTS

SYNOPSIS
       pts-subscribe [options] package

       pts-unsubscribe [options] package

DESCRIPTION
       pts-subscribe  sends  a subscription request for package to the Package
       Tracking System at pts@qa.debian.org, and cancels the  subscription  30
       days later.

       If  called as pts-unsubscribe, send an unsubscription request for pack-
       age to the Package Tracking System.

       This utility is useful if a developer has made  an  NMU  and  wants  to
       track the package for a limited period of time.

OPTIONS
       --until time, -u time
              When  at(1) should cancel the subscription.  time must be speci-
              fied using at's syntax.  Default is 'now + 30 days'.   This  op-
              tion will probably require quoting!

       --forever
              Don't  cancel  the subscription automatically.  This can also be
              specified as --until forever.

       --help, -h
              Display a help message and exit successfully.

       --version
              Display version and copyright information and exit successfully.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       DEBEMAIL, EMAIL
              If one of these is set (with preference give to DEBEMAIL),  then
              this  will  be used for the subscription address.  If neither is
              set, then the email will be sent without a  specified  subscrip-
              tion  address, and the email's From: line will be used to deter-
              mine the sender's address.  This will be determined by mail(1).

CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
       The two configuration files /etc/devscripts.conf and ~/.devscripts  are
       sourced in that order to set configuration variables.  Command line op-
       tions can be used to override configuration file settings.  Environment
       variable  settings  are ignored for this purpose.  The currently recog-
       nised variables are:

       PTS_UNTIL
              Setting this is equivalent to giving a --until option.
