NAME
       svn_load_dirs - Load directories into a Subversion repository

SYNOPSIS
       svn_load_dirs [options] svn_url svn_import_dir [directory ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This tool can be used for importing one or more directories into a Sub-
       version  repository.  The  difference  from  "svn   import"   is   that
       svn_load_dirs  can  update an existing directory tree, and tag it prop-
       erly. Only changes from the previous version will be  recorded  in  the
       revision, so that you can easily apply them on another branch.  For ex-
       ample, this is very useful for managing the upstream source when  main-
       taining Debian packages in Subversion.

OPTIONS
       svn_url
              The base Subversion URL.

       svn_import_dir
              The path relative to svn_url where the directories are to be im-
              ported.

       directory ...
              The directories to import. If they are not specified on the com-
              mand line, they are read from standard input.

       -no_user_input
              Don't ask any questions. Assume that the answer is yes.

       -p filename
              Apply  the  properties specified in the configuration file file-
              name to matching files. See below for a description of the  con-
              figuration file format.

       -svn_username username
              Username to use when committing to the repository.

       -svn_password password
              Password to use when committing to the repository.

       -t tag_dir
              Create  a  tag copy in tag_dir, relative to svn_url. tag_dir may
              contain a regular expression enclosed within '@' characters.  It
              will  be  replaced by the matching part from the imported direc-
              tory names.

       -v     Be more verbose. Use multiple times for increased effect.

       -wc path
              Use the already checked out working  copy  at  path  instead  of
              checking out a new working copy.

PROPERTY CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT
       The  property  configuration file, which is specified by the -p option,
       contains rules for applying properties to the imported files.  It  con-
       sists of lines of the following format:

       regular_expression  control   property_name  property_value

       The meaning of the fields are:

       regular_expression
              A Perl-style regular expression matching the files to apply this
              rule to.

       control
              Either "break" or "cont". If set to "break", processing  of  the
              current  file  will stop if this rule matches. If set to "cont",
              processing will continue. The latter can be used to set multiple
              properties for one file.

       property_name
              (Optional) The name of the property to set.

       property_value
              (Optional) Set the property to this value.

       The last two fields may be omitted, in which case the rule will not set
       any properties. This is useful for excluding certain files from  subse-
       quent rules.

       You  need  to  quote  the  regular_expression,  property_name and prop-
       erty_value fields with double quotes ('"') if you  have  whitespace  in
       them. Single and double quotes can be escaped with backslash ('\').

EXAMPLES
       For  example,  to import the contents of the foo-1.3 directory into the
       upstream/current directory of the foo repository:

       svn_load_dirs    svn+ssh://svn.example.org/svn/foo     upstream/current
              foo-1.3

       A tag can also be added automatically using the -t option:

       svn_load_dirs       svn+ssh://svn.example.org/svn/foo      -t      'up-
              stream/@\d+\.\w+@' upstream/current foo-1.3

       Here's an example of a property configuration file:

       \.doc$              break     svn:mime-type  application/msword
       \.ds(p|w)$          break     svn:eol-style  CRLF
       \.dos2unix-eol\.sh$ break
       .*                  break     svn:eol-style  native

       This example specifies that .doc files are  to  be  treated  as  binary
       files, that .dsp and .dsw files have their line ending characters kept,
       and that all other files except dos2unix-eol.sh have their line endings
       converted to the native style.
