NAME
       weave - translate WEB to TeX

SYNOPSIS
       weave [-x] webfile[.web] [changefile[.ch]]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual page is not meant to be exhaustive.  The complete documen-
       tation for this version of TeX can be found in the info file or  manual
       Web2C: A TeX implementation.

       The  weave  program is used to create a TeX file for viewing a Web pro-
       gram.  It takes appropriate care of typographic details like page  lay-
       out  and  the  use of indentation, italics, boldface, etc., and it sup-
       plies extensive cross-index information that it gathers  automatically.
       The  command  line  arguments are the same as for tangle except for the
       option: -x says to omit the index, module name list, and table of  con-
       tents  pages.   (A CONTENTS.tex file will still be written when the TeX
       file is processed, however, unless some macros in webmac.tex are  rede-
       fined.)

       The  output  TeX  file name is formed by adding .tex to the root of the
       Web file name.

       There are several macros that probably should be redefined by the  pro-
       grammer  at  the  beginning  of the Web file.  It is a good idea to set
       \title to the name of the  program.   And,  to  cause  output  of  only
       changed  modules, one can say \let\maybe=\iffalse (usually as the first
       change in the change file).

ENVIRONMENT
       The environment variable WEBINPUTS is used  to  search  for  the  input
       files,  or  the system default if WEBINPUTS is not set.  See tex(1) for
       the details of the searching.

FILES
       $TEXMFMAIN/tex/plain/base/webmac.tex
           TeX macros used by weave output.
