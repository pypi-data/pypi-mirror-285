NAME
       quilt - tool to manage series of patches

SYNOPSIS
       quilt [-h] command [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Quilt is a tool to manage large sets of patches by keeping track of the
       changes each patch makes.  Patches  can  be  applied,  un-applied,  re-
       freshed, etc. The key philosophical concept is that your primary output
       is patches.

       With quilt, all work occurs within a single  directory  tree.  Commands
       can  be  invoked  from anywhere within the source tree. They are of the
       form quilt cmd similar to CVS, svn or git commands. They can be  abbre-
       viated as long as the specified part of the command is unique. All com-
       mands print some help text with quilt cmd -h.

       Quilt manages a stack of patches. Patches are applied incrementally  on
       top  of the base tree plus all preceding patches. They can be pushed on
       top of the stack (quilt push), and popped off the  stack  (quilt  pop).
       Commands  are  available  for  querying the contents of the series file
       (quilt series, see below), the contents of the  stack  (quilt  applied,
       quilt  previous,  quilt top), and the patches that are not applied at a
       particular moment (quilt next, quilt unapplied).  By default, most com-
       mands apply to the topmost patch on the stack.

       Patch files are located in the patches sub-directory of the source tree
       (see EXAMPLE OF WORKING  TREE  below).  The  QUILT_PATCHES  environment
       variable  can  be used to override this location. When not found in the
       current directory, that subdirectory is  searched  recursively  in  the
       parent  directories  (this  is  similar to the way git searches for its
       configuration files). The patches directory  may  contain  sub-directo-
       ries. It may also be a symbolic link instead of a directory.

       A  file  called series contains a list of patch file names that defines
       the order in which patches are applied. Unless there are means by which
       series  files  can  be  generated automatically, it is usually provided
       along with a set of patches. In this file, each patch file name is on a
       separate  line. Patch files are identified by path names that are rela-
       tive to the patches directory; patches may be in sub-directories  below
       this directory. Lines in the series file that start with a hash charac-
       ter (#) are ignored.  You can also add a comment after each patch  file
       name,  introduced  by a space  followed by a hash character. When quilt
       adds, removes, or renames patches, it automatically updates the  series
       file. Users of quilt can modify series files while some patches are ap-
       plied, as long as the applied patches remain in their original order.

       Different series files can be used to  assemble  patches  in  different
       ways, corresponding for example to different development branches.

       Before  a  patch is applied (or ``pushed on the stack''), copies of all
       files the patch modifies are saved  to  the  .pc/patch  directory.  The
       patch  is  added to the list of currently applied patches (.pc/applied-
       patches). Later when a patch is regenerated (quilt refresh), the backup
       copies in .pc/patch are compared with the current versions of the files
       in the source tree using GNU diff.

       Documentation related to a patch can be put at the beginning of a patch
       file.   Quilt  is careful to preserve all text that precedes the actual
       patch when doing a refresh. (This is limited to patches in unified for-
       mat; see diff documentation).

       The  series  file is looked up in the .pc directory, in the root of the
       source tree, and in the patches directory.  The first series file  that
       is found is used. This may also be a symbolic link, or a file with mul-
       tiple hard links.  Usually, only one series file is used for a  set  of
       patches, so the patches sub-directory is a convenient location.

       The  .pc  directory and its sub-directories cannot be relocated, but it
       can be a symbolic link. While patches are applied to the  source  tree,
       this  directory  is  essential  for  many  operations, including taking
       patches off the stack (quilt pop), and refreshing  patches  (quilt  re-
       fresh).  Files in the .pc directory are automatically removed when they
       are no longer needed, so there is no need to clean up manually.

QUILT COMMANDS REFERENCE
       add [-P patch] {file} ...

           Add one or more files to the topmost or named patch.  Files must be
           added  to the patch before being modified.  Files that are modified
           by patches already applied on top of the specified patch cannot  be
           added.

           -P patch

               Patch to add files to.

       annotate [-P patch] {file}

           Print  an  annotated  listing  of  the specified file showing which
           patches modify which lines. Only applied patches are included.

           -P patch

               Stop checking for changes at the specified rather than the top-
               most patch.

       applied [patch]

           Print a list of applied patches, or all patches up to and including
           the specified patch in the file series.

       delete [-r] [--backup] [patch|-n]

           Remove the specified or topmost patch from the series file.  If the
           patch  is applied, quilt will attempt to remove it first. (Only the
           topmost patch can be removed right now.)

           -n  Delete the next patch after topmost, rather than the  specified
               or topmost patch.

           -r  Remove  the  deleted  patch  file from the patches directory as
               well.

           --backup

               Rename the patch file to patch~ rather than deleting  it.   Ig-
               nored if not used with `-r'.

       diff  [-p  n|-p ab] [-u|-U num|-c|-C num] [--combine patch|-z] [-R] [-P
       patch]  [--snapshot]  [--diff=utility]  [--no-timestamps]  [--no-index]
       [--sort] [--color[=always|auto|never]] [file ...]

           Produces  a  diff of the specified file(s) in the topmost or speci-
           fied patch.  If no files are specified, all files that are modified
           are included.

           -p n
               Create a -p n style patch (-p0 or -p1 are supported).

           -p ab
               Create  a  -p1  style  patch,  but use a/file and b/file as the
               original and new filenames instead of the default dir.orig/file
               and dir/file names.

           -u, -U num, -c, -C num

               Create  a unified diff (-u, -U) with num lines of context. Cre-
               ate a context diff (-c, -C) with num lines of context. The num-
               ber of context lines defaults to 3.

           --no-timestamps

               Do not include file timestamps in patch headers.

           --no-index

               Do not output Index: lines.

           -z  Write  to standard output the changes that have been made rela-
               tive to the topmost or specified patch.

           -R  Create a reverse diff.

           -P patch

               Create a diff for the specified patch.  (Defaults to  the  top-
               most patch.)

           --combine patch

               Create  a  combined diff for all patches between this patch and
               the patch specified with -P. A patch name of `-' is  equivalent
               to specifying the first applied patch.

           --snapshot

               Diff against snapshot (see `quilt snapshot -h').

           --diff=utility

               Use  the specified utility for generating the diff. The utility
               is invoked with the original and new file name as arguments.

           --color[=always|auto|never]

               Use syntax coloring (auto activates it only if the output is  a
               tty).

           --sort
               Sort files by their name instead of preserving the original or-
               der.

       edit file ...

           Edit the specified file(s) in $EDITOR after adding it (them) to the
           topmost patch.

       files [-v] [-a] [-l] [--combine patch] [patch]

           Print  the  list  of  files  that  the  topmost  or specified patch
           changes.

           -a  List all files in all applied patches.

           -l  Add patch name to output.

           -v  Verbose, more user friendly output.

           --combine patch

               Create a listing for all patches between  this  patch  and  the
               topmost  or  specified patch. A patch name of `-' is equivalent
               to specifying the first applied patch.

       fold [-R] [-q] [-f] [-p strip-level]

           Integrate the patch read  from  standard  input  into  the  topmost
           patch:  After  making  sure that all files modified are part of the
           topmost patch, the patch is applied with the specified strip  level
           (which defaults to 1).

           -R  Apply patch in reverse.

           -q  Quiet operation.

           -f  Force  apply,  even  if  the patch has rejects. Unless in quiet
               mode, apply the patch interactively: the patch utility may  ask
               questions.

           -p strip-level

               The number of pathname components to strip from file names when
               applying patchfile.

       fork [new_name]

           Fork the topmost patch.  Forking a patch means creating a  verbatim
           copy  of  it under a new name, and use that new name instead of the
           original one in the current series.  This is useful  when  a  patch
           has  to  be modified, but the original version of it should be pre-
           served, e.g.  because it is used in another series, or for the his-
           tory.   A  typical  sequence  of commands would be: fork, edit, re-
           fresh.

           If new_name is missing, the name of the forked patch  will  be  the
           current  patch  name,  followed by `-2'.  If the patch name already
           ends in a dash-and-number, the number is further incremented (e.g.,
           patch.diff, patch-2.diff, patch-3.diff).

       graph  [--all] [--reduce] [--lines[=num]] [--edge-labels=files] [-T ps]
       [patch]

           Generate a dot(1) directed graph showing the  dependencies  between
           applied patches. A patch depends on another patch if both touch the
           same file or, with the --lines option, if their modifications over-
           lap.  Unless  otherwise  specified,  the graph includes all patches
           that the topmost patch depends on.  When a patch name is specified,
           instead  of  the  topmost  patch,  create a graph for the specified
           patch. The graph will include all other patches that this patch de-
           pends on, as well as all patches that depend on this patch.

           --all
               Generate a graph including all applied patches and their depen-
               dencies. (Unapplied patches are not included.)

           --reduce

               Eliminate transitive edges from the graph.

           --lines[=num]

               Compute dependencies by looking at the lines the  patches  mod-
               ify.  Unless a different num is specified, two lines of context
               are included.

           --edge-labels=files

               Label graph edges with the file names that the adjacent patches
               modify.

           -T ps
               Directly produce a PostScript output file.

       grep [-h|options] {pattern}

           Grep  through  the  source files, recursively, skipping patches and
           quilt meta-information. If no filename argument is given, the whole
           source tree is searched. Please see the grep(1) manual page for op-
           tions.

           -h  Print this help. The grep -h option can be passed after a  dou-
               ble-dash (--). Search expressions that start with a dash can be
               passed after a second double-dash (-- --).

       header  [-a|-r|-e]  [--backup]  [--dep3]  [--strip-diffstat]  [--strip-
       trailing-whitespace] [patch]

           Print or change the header of the topmost or specified patch.

           -a, -r, -e

               Append  to  (-a)  or replace (-r) the existing patch header, or
               edit (-e) the header in $EDITOR. If none of  these  options  is
               given, print the patch header.

           --strip-diffstat

               Strip diffstat output from the header.

           --strip-trailing-whitespace

               Strip trailing whitespace at the end of lines of the header.

           --backup

               Create a backup copy of the old version of a patch as patch~.

           --dep3

               When editing (-e), insert a template with DEP-3 headers.  DEP-3
               is http://dep.debian.net/deps/dep3/ Patch Tagging Guidelines.

       import [-p num] [-R] [-P patch] [-f] [-d {o|a|n}] patchfile ...

           Import external patches.  The patches will  be  inserted  following
           the  current  top  patch,  and must be pushed after import to apply
           them.

           -p num

               Number of directory levels to strip when applying (default=1)

           -R

               Apply patch in reverse.

           -P patch

               Patch filename to use inside quilt. This  option  can  only  be
               used when importing a single patch.

           -f  Overwrite/update existing patches.

           -d {o|a|n}

               When  overwriting in existing patch, keep the old (o), all (a),
               or new (n) patch header. If both patches include headers,  this
               option must be specified. This option is only effective when -f
               is used.

               The quilt meta-data is now initialized.

       mail  {--mbox  file|--send}  [-m  text]  [-M  file]  [--prefix  prefix]
       [--sender  ...]  [--from ...] [--to ...] [--cc ...] [--bcc ...] [--sub-
       ject ...]  [--reply-to  message]  [--charset  ...]  [--signature  file]
       [first_patch [last_patch]]

           Create  mail  messages  from  a  specified range of patches, or all
           patches in the series file, and either  store  them  in  a  mailbox
           file,  or  send  them immediately. The editor is opened with a tem-
           plate      for      the       introduction.        Please       see
           /usr/share/doc/quilt/README.MAIL  for  details.   When specifying a
           range of patches, a first patch name of `-' denotes the first,  and
           a last patch name of `-' denotes the last patch in the series.

           -m text

               Text  to  use as the text in the introduction. When this option
               is used, the editor will not be invoked, and the  patches  will
               be processed immediately.

           -M file

               Like the -m option, but read the introduction from file.

           --prefix prefix

               Use  an  alternate prefix in the bracketed part of the subjects
               generated. Defaults to `patch'.

           --mbox file

               Store all messages in the specified file in  mbox  format.  The
               mbox can later be sent using formail, for example.

           --send

               Send the messages directly.

           --sender

               The  envelope sender address to use. The address must be of the
               form `user@domain.name'. No display name is allowed.

           --from, --subject

               The values for the From and  Subject  headers  to  use.  If  no
               --from  option  is  given,  the value of the --sender option is
               used.

           --to, --cc, --bcc

               Append a recipient to the To, Cc, or Bcc header.

           --charset

               Specify a particular message encoding on  systems  which  don't
               use  UTF-8  or  ISO-8859-15. This character encoding must match
               the one used in the patches.

           --signature file

               Append the specified signature to messages (defaults to ~/.sig-
               nature if found; use `-' for no signature).

           --reply-to message

               Add the appropriate headers to reply to the specified message.

       new [-p n|-p ab] {patchname}

           Create  a new patch with the specified file name, and insert it af-
           ter the topmost patch. The name can be prefixed with  a  sub-direc-
           tory name, allowing for grouping related patches together.

           -p n
               Create a -p n style patch (-p0 or -p1 are supported).

           -p ab
               Create  a  -p1  style  patch,  but use a/file and b/file as the
               original and new filenames instead of the default dir.orig/file
               and dir/file names.

               Quilt  can  be used in sub-directories of a source tree. It de-
               termines the root of a source tree by searching for  a  patches
               directory above the current working directory. Create a patches
               directory in the intended root directory  if  quilt  chooses  a
               top-level directory that is too high up in the directory tree.

       next [patch]

           Print  the  name  of  the next patch after the specified or topmost
           patch in the series file.

       patches [-v] [--color[=always|auto|never]] {file} [files...]

           Print the list of patches that modify any of the  specified  files.
           (Uses  a  heuristic  to determine which files are modified by unap-
           plied patches.  Note that this heuristic is much slower than  scan-
           ning applied patches.)

           -v  Verbose, more user friendly output.

           --color[=always|auto|never]

               Use  syntax coloring (auto activates it only if the output is a
               tty).

       pop [-afRqv] [--refresh] [num|patch]

           Remove patch(es) from the stack of applied  patches.   Without  op-
           tions,  the  topmost patch is removed.  When a number is specified,
           remove the specified number of patches.  When a patch name is spec-
           ified,  remove  patches  until the specified patch end up on top of
           the stack.  Patch names may  include  the  patches/  prefix,  which
           means that filename completion can be used.

           -a  Remove all applied patches.

           -f  Force  remove. The state before the patch(es) were applied will
               be restored from backup files.

           -R  Always verify if the patch removes cleanly; don't rely on time-
               stamp checks.

           -q  Quiet operation.

           -v  Verbose operation.

           --refresh

               Automatically refresh every patch before it gets unapplied.

       previous [patch]

           Print  the  name of the previous patch before the specified or top-
           most patch in the series file.

       push  [-afqvm]  [--fuzz=N]  [--merge[=merge|diff3]]   [--leave-rejects]
       [--color[=always|auto|never]] [--refresh] [num|patch]

           Apply  patch(es)  from  the series file.  Without options, the next
           patch in the series file is applied.  When a number  is  specified,
           apply the specified number of patches.  When a patch name is speci-
           fied, apply all patches up to and including  the  specified  patch.
           Patch names may include the patches/ prefix, which means that file-
           name completion can be used. The mtime of all touched files will be
           exactly the same to prevent time skews.

           -a  Apply all patches in the series file.

           -q  Quiet operation.

           -f  Force apply, even if the patch has rejects.

           -v  Verbose operation.

           --fuzz=N

               Set the maximum fuzz factor (default: 2).

           -m, --merge[=merge|diff3]

               Merge the patch file into the original files (see patch(1)).

           --leave-rejects

               Leave around the reject files patch produced, even if the patch
               is not actually applied.

           --color[=always|auto|never]

               Use syntax coloring (auto activates it only if the output is  a
               tty).

           --refresh

               Automatically refresh every patch after it was successfully ap-
               plied.

       refresh [-p n|-p ab] [-u|-U num|-c|-C num] [-z[new_name]]  [-f]  [--no-
       timestamps]  [--no-index]  [--diffstat]  [--sort]  [--backup] [--strip-
       trailing-whitespace] [patch]

           Refreshes the specified patch, or the  topmost  patch  by  default.
           Documentation  that comes before the actual patch in the patch file
           is retained.

           It is possible to refresh patches that are  not  on  top.   If  any
           patches  on  top of the patch to refresh modify the same files, the
           script aborts by default.  Patches can still be refreshed with  -f.
           In  that  case  this  script will print a warning for each shadowed
           file, changes by more recent patches  will  be  ignored,  and  only
           changes  in  files  that  have not been modified by any more recent
           patches will end up in the specified patch.

           -p n
               Create a -p n style patch (-p0 or -p1 supported).

           -p ab
               Create a -p1 style patch, but use  a/file  and  b/file  as  the
               original and new filenames instead of the default dir.orig/file
               and dir/file names.

           -u, -U num, -c, -C num

               Create a unified diff (-u, -U) with num lines of context.  Cre-
               ate a context diff (-c, -C) with num lines of context. The num-
               ber of context lines defaults to 3.

           -z[new_name]

               Create a new patch containing the changes instead of refreshing
               the  topmost  patch. If no new name is specified, `-2' is added
               to the original patch name, etc. (See the fork command.)

           --no-timestamps

               Do not include file timestamps in patch headers.

           --no-index

               Do not output Index: lines.

           --diffstat

               Add a diffstat section to the patch header, or replace the  ex-
               isting diffstat section.

           -f  Enforce refreshing of a patch that is not on top.

           --backup

               Create a backup copy of the old version of a patch as patch~.

           --sort
               Sort files by their name instead of preserving the original or-
               der.

           --strip-trailing-whitespace

               Strip trailing whitespace at the end of lines.

       remove [-P patch] {file} ...

           Remove one or more files from the topmost or  named  patch.   Files
           that  are  modified by patches on top of the specified patch cannot
           be removed.

           -P patch

               Remove named files from the named patch.

       rename [-P patch] new_name

           Rename the topmost or named patch.

           -P patch

               Patch to rename.

       revert [-P patch] {file} ...

           Revert uncommitted changes to the topmost or named  patch  for  the
           specified  file(s):  after the revert, 'quilt diff -z' will show no
           differences for those files. Changes to files that are modified  by
           patches on top of the specified patch cannot be reverted.

           -P patch

               Revert changes in the named patch.

       series [--color[=always|auto|never]] [-v]

           Print the names of all patches in the series file.

           --color[=always|auto|never]

               Use  syntax coloring (auto activates it only if the output is a
               tty).

           -v  Verbose, more user friendly output.

       setup   [-d   path-prefix]   [-v]    [--sourcedir    dir]    [--fuzz=N]
       [--slow|--fast] {specfile|seriesfile}

           Initializes  a  source tree from an rpm spec file or a quilt series
           file.

           -d  Optional path prefix for the resulting source tree.

           --sourcedir

               Directory that contains the package sources. Defaults to `.'.

           -v  Verbose debug output.

           --fuzz=N

               Set the maximum fuzz factor (needs rpm 4.6 or later).

           --slow
               Use the original, slow method to process the spec file. This is
               the  default  for  now, but that might change in the future. In
               this mode, rpmbuild generates a working tree in a temporary di-
               rectory while all its actions are recorded, and then everything
               is replayed from scratch in the target directory.

           --fast
               Use an alternative, faster method to process the spec file.  In
               this mode, rpmbuild is told to generate a working tree directly
               in the target directory. If the input is a series file,  it  is
               assumed  that all archives have been extracted manually before-
               hand.

       shell [command]

           Launch a shell in a duplicate environment. After exiting the shell,
           any  modifications made in this environment are applied to the top-
           most patch.

           If a command is specified, it is executed instead of launching  the
           shell.

       snapshot [-d]

           Take  a  snapshot  of  the current working state.  After taking the
           snapshot, the tree can be modified in  the  usual  ways,  including
           pushing and popping patches.  A diff against the tree at the moment
           of the snapshot can be generated with `quilt diff --snapshot'.

           -d  Only remove current snapshot.

       top

           Print the name of the topmost patch on the current stack of applied
           patches.

       unapplied [patch]

           Print  a  list of patches that are not applied, or all patches that
           follow the specified patch in the series file.

       upgrade

           Upgrade the meta-data in a working tree  from  an  old  version  of
           quilt  to the current version. This command is only needed when the
           quilt meta-data format has changed, and the working tree still con-
           tains old-format meta-data. In that case, quilt will request to run
           `quilt upgrade'.

COMMON OPTIONS TO ALL COMMANDS
       --trace

               Runs the command in bash trace mode (-x). For  internal  debug-
               ging.

       --quiltrc file

               Use  the specified configuration file instead of ~/.quiltrc (or
               /etc/quilt.quiltrc if ~/.quiltrc does not exist).  See the  pdf
               documentation  for  details  about  its possible contents.  The
               special value "-" causes quilt not to  read  any  configuration
               file.

       --version

               Print the version number and exit immediately.

EXIT STATUS
       The  exit status is 0 if the sub-command was successfully executed, and
       1 in case of error.

       An exit status of 2 denotes that quilt did not do anything to  complete
       the  command.   This happens in particular when asking to push when the
       whole stack is already pushed, or asking to pop when the whole stack is
       already popped.  This behavior is intended to ease the scripting around
       quilt.

EXAMPLE OF WORKING TREE

              |     series         (list of patches to apply)

       The patches/ directory is precious as it contains all your  patches  as
       well as the order in which it should be applied.

       The  .pc/  directory  contains some metadata about the current state of
       your patch series. Changing its content is not advised. This  directory
       can  usually  be  regenerated from the initial files and the content of
       the patches/ directory (provided that all patches were regenerated  be-
       fore the removal).

EXAMPLE
       Please refer to the pdf documentation for a full example of use.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       Upon  startup, quilt evaluates the file .quiltrc in the user's home di-
       rectory, or the file specified with the --quiltrc option.  This file is
       a  regular bash script. Default options can be passed to any COMMAND by
       defining    a    QUILT_${COMMAND}_ARGS    variable.     For    example,
       QUILT_DIFF_ARGS="--color=auto"  causes  the  output of quilt diff to be
       syntax colored when writing to a terminal.

       In addition to that, quilt recognizes the following variables:

       EDITOR

           The program to run to edit files.  If it  isn't  redefined  in  the
           configuration  file,  $EDITOR as defined in the environment will be
           used.

       LESS

           The arguments used to invoke  the  pager.   Inherits  the  existing
           value of $LESS if LESS is already set in the environment, otherwise
           defaults to "-FRSX".

       QUILT_DIFF_OPTS

           Additional options that quilt shall pass to GNU diff when  generat-
           ing  patches.  A  useful  setting  for C source code is "-p", which
           causes GNU diff to show in the resulting  patch  which  function  a
           change is in.

       QUILT_PATCH_OPTS

           Additional options that quilt shall pass to GNU patch when applying
           patches.  For example, recent versions of  GNU  patch  support  the
           "--reject-format=unified"  option  for  generating  reject files in
           unified diff style (older patch  versions  used  "--unified-reject-
           files" for that).

           You  may  also  want to add the "-E" option if you have issues with
           quilt not deleting empty files when you think it should. The  docu-
           mentation  of GNU patch says that "normally this option is unneces-
           sary", but when patch is in POSIX  mode  or  if  the  patch  format
           doesn't  allow  one  to distinguish empty files from deleted files,
           patch deletes empty files only if the -E option  is  given.  Beware
           that when passing -E to patch, quilt will no longer be able to deal
           with empty files, which is why using -E is no longer the default.

       QUILT_DIFFSTAT_OPTS

           Additional options that quilt shall pass to diffstat when  generat-
           ing  patch statistics. For example, "-f0" can be used for an alter-
           native output format. Recent versions of diffstat also support  al-
           ternative rounding methods ("-r1", "-r2").

       QUILT_PATCHES

           The location of patch files, defaulting to "patches".

       QUILT_SERIES

           The  name of the series file, defaulting to "series". Unless an ab-
           solute path is used, the search algorithm described above applies.

       QUILT_PATCHES_PREFIX

           If set to anything, quilt will prefix patch names  it  prints  with
           their directory (QUILT_PATCHES).

       QUILT_NO_DIFF_INDEX

           By  default, quilt prepends an Index: line to the patches it gener-
           ates.  If this variable is set to anything, no line  is  prepended.
           This is a shortcut to adding --no-index to both QUILT_DIFF_ARGS and
           QUILT_REFRESH_ARGS.

       QUILT_NO_DIFF_TIMESTAMPS

           By default, quilt includes timestamps in  headers  when  generating
           patches.  If this variable is set to anything, no timestamp will be
           included.  This is a shortcut to  adding  --no-timestamps  to  both
           QUILT_DIFF_ARGS and QUILT_REFRESH_ARGS.

       QUILT_PAGER

           The pager quilt shall use for commands which produce paginated out-
           put. If unset, the values of GIT_PAGER or PAGER is used.   If  none
           of these variables is set, "less -R" is used.  An empty value indi-
           cates that no pager should be used.

       QUILT_COLORS

           By default, quilt uses its predefined color set in order to be more
           comprehensible  when  distiguishing  various  types of patches, eg.
           applied/unapplied, failed, etc.

           To override one or more color settings, set the QUILT_COLORS  vari-
           able  in  following  syntax - colon (:) separated list of elements,
           each being of the  form  <format  name>=<foreground  color>[;<back-
           ground color>]

           Format names with their respective default values are listed below,
           along with their usage(s).  Color codes(values) are  standard  bash
           coloring        escape        codes.        See       more       at
           http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/colorizing.html#AEN20229

           diff_hdr  Used in 'quilt diff' to color the index line. Defaults to
                     32 (green).

           diff_add  Used in 'quilt diff' to color added lines. Defaults to 36
                     (azure).

           diff_mod  Used in 'quilt diff' to color modified lines. Defaults to
                     35 (purple).

           diff_rem  Used  in 'quilt diff' to color removed lines. Defaults to
                     35 (purple).

           diff_hunk Used in 'quilt diff' to color hunk header. Defaults to 33
                     (brown/orange).

           diff_ctx  Used  in 'quilt diff' to color the text after end of hunk
                     header (diff --show-c-function generates this).  Defaults
                     to 35 (purple).

           diff_cctx Used  in  'quilt  diff' to color the 15-asterisk sequence
                     before or after a hunk. Defaults to 33 (brown/orange).

           patch_fuzz
                     Used in 'quilt push' to color the patch fuzz information.
                     Defaults to 35 (purple).

           patch_fail
                     Used  in 'quilt push' to color the fail message. Defaults
                     to 31 (red).

           series_app
                     Used in 'quilt series' and 'quilt patches' to  color  the
                     applied patch names. Defaults to 32 (green).

           series_top
                     Used  in  'quilt series' and 'quilt patches' to color the
                     top patch name. Defaults to 33 (brown/orange).

           series_una
                     Used in 'quilt series' and 'quilt patches' to color unap-
                     plied patch names. Defaults to 0 (no special color).

           In addition, the clear format name is used to turn off special col-
           oring. Its value is 0; it is not advised to modify it.

           The content of QUILT_COLORS supersedes default values. So the value
           diff_hdr=35;44  will  get you the diff headers in magenta over blue
           instead of the default green over unchanged background.  For  that,
           add the following content to ~/.quiltrc (or /etc/quilt.quiltrc):

           QUILT_DIFF_ARGS="--color"
           QUILT_COLORS='diff_hdr=35;44'

AUTHORS
       Quilt  started  as a series of scripts written by Andrew Morton (patch-
       scripts). Based  on  Andrew's  ideas,  Andreas  Gruenbacher  completely
       rewrote  the  scripts, with the help of several other contributors (see
       AUTHORS file in the distribution).

       This man page was written by Martin Quinson, based on information found
       in the pdf documentation, and in the help messages of each commands.
