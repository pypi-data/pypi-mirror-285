NAME
       lintian - Static analysis tool for Debian packages

SYNOPSIS
       lintian [action] [options] [packages] ...

DESCRIPTION
       Lintian dissects Debian packages and reports bugs and policy
       violations.  It contains automated checks for many aspects of Debian
       policy as well as some checks for common errors.

       There are two ways to specify binary, udeb or source packages for
       Lintian to process: by file name (the .deb file for a binary package or
       the .dsc file for a source package), or by naming a .changes file.

       If you specify a .changes file, Lintian will process all packages
       listed in that file.  This is convenient when checking a new package
       before uploading it.

       If you specify packages to be checked or use the option
       --packages-from-file, the packages requested will be processed.
       Otherwise, if debian/changelog exists, it is parsed to determine the
       name of the .changes file to look for in the parent directory (when
       using the actions --check or --unpack).  See "CHECKING LAST BUILD" for
       more information.

OPTIONS
       Actions of the lintian command: (Only one action can be specified per
       invocation)

       -c, --check
           Run all checks over the specified packages.  This is the default
           action.

       -C chk1,chk2,..., --check-part chk1,chk2,...
           Run only the specified checks.  You can either specify the name of
           the check script or the abbreviation.  For details, see the
           "CHECKS" section below.

       -F, --ftp-master-rejects
           Run only the checks that issue tags that result in automatic
           rejects from the Debian upload queue.  The list of such tags is
           refreshed with each Lintian release, so may be slightly out of date
           if it has changed recently.

           This is implemented via a profile and thus this option cannot be
           used together with --profile.

       -T tag1,tag2,..., --tags tag1,tag2,...
           Run only the checks that issue the requested tags.  The tests for
           other tags within the check scripts will be run but the tags will
           not be issued.

           With this options all tags listed will be displayed regardless of
           the display settings.

       --tags-from-file filename
           Same functionality as --tags, but read the list of tags from a
           file.  Blank lines and lines beginning with # are ignored.  All
           other lines are taken to be tag names or comma-separated lists of
           tag names to (potentially) issue.

           With this options all tags listed will be displayed regardless of
           the display settings.

       -u, --unpack
           Unpacks the package will all collections.  See the "COLLECTION"
           section below.

           Note in this option will also run all collections.  See the
           "COLLECTION" section below.

       -X chk1,chk2,..., --dont-check-part chk1,chk2,...
           Run all but the specified checks.  You can either specify the name
           of the check script or the abbreviation.  For details, see the
           "CHECKS" section below.

       General options:

       -h, --help
           Display usage information and exit.

       -q, --quiet
           Suppress all informational messages including override comments
           (normally shown with --show-overrides).

           This option is silently ignored if --debug is given.  Otherwise, if
           both --verbose and --quiet is used, the last of these two options
           take effect.

           This option overrides the verbose and the quiet variable in the
           configuration file.  In the configuration file, this option is
           enabled by using quiet variable.  The verbose and quiet variables
           may not both appear in the config file.

       -v, --verbose
           Display verbose messages.

           If --debug is used this option is always enabled.  Otherwise, if
           both --verbose and --quiet is used (and --debug is not used), the
           last of these two options take effect.

           This option overrides the quiet variable in the configuration file.
           In the configuration file, this option is enabled by using verbose
           variable.  The verbose and quiet variables may not both appear in
           the config file.

       -V, --version
           Display lintian version number and exit.

       --print-version
           Print unadorned version number and exit.

       Behavior options for lintian.

       --color (never|always|auto|html)
           Whether to colorize tags in lintian output based on their
           visibility.  The default is "never", which never uses color.
           "always" will always use color, "auto" will use color only if the
           output is going to a terminal, and "html" will use HTML <span> tags
           with a color style attribute (instead of ANSI color escape
           sequences).

           This option overrides the color variable in the configuration file.

       --hyperlinks (on|off)
           Shows text-based hyperlinks to tag descriptions on
           lintian.debian.org on terminals that support it. The default is on
           for terminals that support it, unless the user selected '--color
           never'. This currently only works in GNOME Terminal.

           This option overrides the color variable in the configuration file.

       --default-display-level
           Reset the current display level to the default.  Basically, this
           option behaves exactly like passing the following options to
           lintian:

               -L ">=warning"

           The primary use for this is to ensure that lintian's display level
           has been reset to the built-in default values.  Notably, this can
           be used to override display settings earlier on the command-line or
           in the lintian configuration file.

           Further changes to the display level can be done after this option.
           Example: --default-display-level --display-info gives you the
           default display level plus informational ("I:") tags.

       --display-source X
           Only display tags from the source X (e.g. the Policy Manual or the
           Developer Reference).  This option can be used multiple times to
           add additional sources.  Example sources are "policy" or "devref"
           being the Policy Manual and the Developer Reference (respectively).

           The entire list of sources can be found in
           $LINTIAN_ROOT/data/output/manual-references

       -E, --display-experimental, --no-display-experimental
           Control whether to display experimental ("X:") tags.  They are
           normally suppressed.

           If a tag is marked experimental, this means that the code that
           generates this message is not as well tested as the rest of
           Lintian, and might still give surprising results.  Feel free to
           ignore Experimental messages that do not seem to make sense, though
           of course bug reports are always welcome (particularly if they
           include fixes).

           These options overrides the display-experimental variable in the
           configuration file.

       -i, --info
           Print explanatory information about each problem discovered in
           addition to the lintian error tags. To print a long tag description
           without running lintian, see lintian-info(1).

           This option overrides info variable in the configuration file.

       -I, --display-info
           Display informational ("I:") tags as well.  They are normally
           suppressed.  (This is equivalent to -L ">=info").

           This option overrides the display-info variable in the
           configuration file.

           Note: display-level and display-info may not both appear in the
           configuration file.

       -L [+|-|=][>=|>|=|<|<=][S|C|S/C], --display-level
       [+|-|=][>=|>|=|<|<=][S|C|S/C]
           Fine-grained selection of tags to be displayed. It is possible to
           add, remove or set the levels to display, specifying a visibility
           (error, warning, info, pedantic, or classification. The default
           settings are equivalent to -L ">=warning".

           The value consists of 3 parts, where two of them are optional.  The
           parts are:

           modifier operator
               How to affect the current display level.  Can be one of add to
               ("+"), remove from ("-") or set to ("=") the display level(s)
               denoted by the following selection.

               The default value is "=" (i.e. set the display level).

           set operator
               The visibility to be selected.  The operator can be one of
               ">=", ">", "=", "<" or "<=".  As an example, this can be used
               to select all info (and more serious) tags via ">=info".

               The default value is "=", which means "exactly" the given
               visibility.

           This option overrides the display-level variable in the
           configuration file.  The value of the display-level in
           configuration file should be space separated entries in the same
           format as passed via command-line.

           Note: display-level may not be used with display-info or pedantic
           in the configuration file.

       -o, --no-override
           Ignore all overrides provided by the package.  This option will
           overrule --show-overrides.

           This option overrides the override variable in the configuration
           file.

       --pedantic
           Display pedantic ("P:") tags as well.  They are normally
           suppressed.  (This is equivalent to -L "+=pedantic").

           Pedantic tags are Lintian at its most pickiest and include checks
           for particular Debian packaging styles and checks that many people
           disagree with.  Expect false positives and Lintian tags that you
           don't consider useful if you use this option.  Adding overrides for
           pedantic tags is probably not worth the effort.

           This option overrides the pedantic variable in the configuration
           file.

           Note: pedantic and display-level may not both appear in the
           configuration file.

       --profile vendor[/prof]
           Use the profile from vendor (or the profile with that name).  If
           the profile name does not contain a slash, the default profile for
           than vendor is chosen.

           As an example, if you are on Ubuntu and want to use Lintian's
           Debian checks, you can use:

             --profile debian

           Likewise, on a Debian machine you can use this to request the
           Ubuntu checks.

           If the token {VENDOR} appears in the profile name, lintian will
           substitute the token with a vendor name to find the profile.
           lintian uses Dpkg::Vendor to determine the best vendor to use (the
           closer to the current vendor, the better).  This is mostly useful
           for people implementing their own checks on top of Lintian.

           If not specified, the default value is {VENDOR}/main.

           Please Refer to the Lintian User Manual for the full documentation
           of profiles.

       --show-overrides, --hide-overrides
           Controls whether tags that have been overridden should be shown.

           The --show-overrides differs from --no-overrides in that shown
           overridden tags will still be marked as overridden (using an "O"
           code).

           If the overridden tags are shown, the related override comments
           will also be displayed (unless --quiet is used).  Please refer to
           the Lintian User Manual for the documentation on how lintian
           relates comments to a given override.

           These options override the show-overrides variable in the
           configuration file.

       --suppress-tags tag1,tag2,...
           Suppress the listed tags.  They will not be reported if they occur
           and will not affect the exit status of Lintian.  This option can be
           given multiple times and can be mixed with
           --suppress-tags-from-file.

           This option can be used together with --dont-check-part ("Not those
           checks nor these tags") and --check-part ("Only those checks, but
           not these tags (from those checks)") to further reduce the
           selection of tags.

           When used with --tags, this option is mostly ignored.

       --suppress-tags-from-file file
           Suppress all tags listed in the given file.  Blank lines and lines
           beginning with # are ignored.  All other lines are taken to be tag
           names or comma-separated lists of tag names to suppress.  The
           suppressed tags will not be reported if they occur and will not
           affect the exit status of Lintian.

           Tags parsed from the file will be handled as if they had been given
           to the --suppress-tags option (e.g. ignored if --tags is used).

       --tag-display-limit[=X]
           By default, lintian limits itself to emitting at most 4 instances
           of each tag per processable when STDOUT is a TTY.  This option
           specified that limit.  See also --no-tag-display-limit.

       --no-tag-display-limit
           By default, lintian limits itself to emitting at most 4 instances
           of each tag per processable when STDOUT is a TTY.  This option
           disables that limit.

           When STDOUT is not a TTY, lintian has no limit. See also
           --tag-display-limit.

       Configuration options:

       --cfg configfile
           Read the configuration from configfile rather than the default
           locations.  This option overrides the LINTIAN_CFG environment
           variable.

       --no-cfg
           Do not read any configuration file.  This option overrides the
           --cfg above.

       --ignore-lintian-env
           Ignore all environment variables starting with LINTIAN_.

           This option is mostly useful for applications running lintian for
           checking packages and do not want the invoking user to affect the
           result (by setting LINTIAN_PROFILE etc.).

           Note it does not cause lintian to ignore the entire environment
           like TMPDIR or DEB_VENDOR.  The latter can affect the default
           profile (or "{VENDOR}" token for --profile).

           Should usually be combined with --no-user-dirs (or unsetting $HOME
           and all XDG_ variables).

       --include-dir dir
           Use dir as an additional "LINTIAN_ROOT".  The directory is expected
           have a similar layout to the LINTIAN_ROOT (if it exists), but does
           not need to be a full self-contained root.

           lintian will check this directory for (additional) profiles, data
           files, support libraries and checks.  The latter two imply that
           Lintian may attempt to load and execute code from this directory.

           This option may appear more than once; each time adding an
           additional directory.  Directories are searched in the order they
           appear on the command line.

           The additional directories will be checked after the user
           directories (though see --no-user-dirs) and before the core
           LINTIAN_ROOT.

           Note: This option should be the very first if given.

       -j X, --jobs=X
           Set the limit for how many unpacking jobs Lintian will run in
           parallel.  This option overrides the jobs variable in the
           configuration file.

           By default Lintian will use nproc to determine a reasonable default
           (or 2, if the nproc fails).

       --user-dirs, --no-user-dirs
           By default, lintian will check $HOME and /etc for files supplied by
           the user or the local sysadmin (e.g. config files and profiles).
           This default can be disabled (and re-enabled) by using
           --no-user-dirs (and --user-dirs, respectively).

           These options will not affect the inclusion of LINTIAN_ROOT, which
           is always included.

           These option can appear multiple times, in which case the last of
           them to appear determines the result.

           Note that if the intention is only to disable the user's $HOME,
           then unsetting $HOME and XDG_*_HOME may suffice.  Alternatively,
           /etc can be "re-added" by using --include-dir (caveat:
           /etc/lintianrc will be ignored by this).

           If the intention is to avoid (unintentional) side-effects from the
           calling user, then this option could be combined with
           --ignore-lintian-env.

           If for some reason --no-user-dirs cannot be used, then consider
           unsetting $HOME and all the $XDG_* variables (not just the
           $XDG_*_HOME ones).

           Note: This option should be the very first if given.

       Developer/Special usage options:

       --allow-root
           Override lintian's warning when it is run with superuser
           privileges.

       --keep-lab
           By default, temporary labs will be removed after lintian is
           finished.  Specifying this options will leave the lab behind, which
           might be useful for debugging purposes.  You can find out where the
           temporary lab is located by running lintian with the --verbose
           option.

       --packages-from-file X
           The line is read as the path to a file to process (all whitespace
           is included!).

           If X is "-", Lintian will read the packages from STDIN.

       --perf-debug
           Enable performance related debug logging.

           The data logged and the format used is subject to change with every
           release.

           Note that some of the information may also be available (possibly
           in a different format) with the --debug option.

       --perf-output OUTPUT
           Write performance related debug information to the specified file
           or file descriptor.  If OUTPUT starts with a '&' or '+', Lintian
           will handle OUTPUT specially.  Otherwise, Lintian will open the
           file denoted by OUTPUT for writing (truncating if it exists,
           creating it if it does not exist).

           If the first character of OUTPUT is a & and the rest of argument is
           a number N, then lintian attempts to write it to the file
           descriptor with the number N.  Said file descriptor must be open
           for writing.  E.g &2 makes Lintian write the performance logging to
           STDERR.

           If the first character of OUTPUT is a +, Lintian will append to the
           file rather than truncating it.  In this case, the file name is
           OUTPUT with initial "+" character removed.  E.g. +my-file makes
           Lintian append to my-file

           If Lintian should write the output to a file starting with a
           literal '&' or '+', then simply prefix it with "./" (e.g.
           "+my-file" becomes "./+my-file").

           If this option omitted, Lintian will default to using STDOUT.

       -U info1,info2,..., --unpack-info info1,info2,...
           Collect information info1, info2, etc. even if these are not
           required by the checks.  Collections requested by this option are
           also not auto-removed (in this run).

           This option is mostly useful for debugging or special purpose
           setups.

           It is allowed to give this option more than once.  The following
           two lines of arguments are semantically equivalent:

            -U info1 -U info2
            -U info1,info2

CHECKS

       Lintian looks for its configuration file in the following locations:

       o   $LINTIAN_CFG

       o   $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lintian/lintianrc

       o   $HOME/.lintianrc

           Deprecated in Lintian/2.5.12 and newer (use the XDG based variant
           above)

       o   XGD_DIR/lintian/lintianrc

           Where XGD_DIR is a directories listed in $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS (or
           /etc/xdg if $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS is unset).

       o   /etc/lintianrc

           Deprecated in Lintian/2.5.12 and newer (use the XDG based variant
           above)

       Lintian uses the following directories:

       /tmp
           Lintian defaults to creating a temporary lab directory in /tmp.  To
           change the directory used, set the TMPDIR environment variable to a
           suitable directory.  TMPDIR can be set in the configuration file.

       /usr/share/lintian/checks
           Scripts that check aspects of a package.

       /usr/share/lintian/collection
           Scripts that collect information about a package and store it for
           use by the check scripts.

       /usr/share/lintian/data
           Supporting data used by Lintian checks and for output formatting.

       /usr/share/lintian/lib
           Utility scripts used by the other lintian scripts.

       For binary packages, Lintian looks for overrides in a file named
       usr/share/lintian/overrides/<package> inside the binary package, where
       <package> is the name of the binary package.  For source packages,
       Lintian looks for overrides in debian/source/lintian-overrides and then
       in debian/source.lintian-overrides if the first file is not found.  The
       first path is preferred.  See the Lintian User's Manual for the syntax
       of overrides.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       The configuration file can be used to specify default values for some
       options.  The general format is:

        option = value

       All whitespace adjacent to the "=" sign as well as leading and trailing
       whitespace is ignored.  However whitespace within the value is
       respected, as demonstrated by this example:

        # Parsed as "opt1" with value "val1"
           opt1    =   val1
        # Parsed as "opt2" with value "val2.1  val2.2     val2.3"
        opt2 = val2.1  val2.2     val2.3

       Unless otherwise specified, no option may appear more than once.
       Lintian will ignore empty lines or lines starting with the #-character.

       Generally options will be the long form of the command-line option
       without the leading dashes.  There some exceptions (such as --profile),
       where Lintian uses the same name as the environment variable.

       Lintian only allows a subset of the options specified in the
       configuration file; please refer to the individual options in
       "OPTIONS".

       In the configuration file, all options listed must have a value, even
       if they do not accept a value on command line (e.g. --pedantic).  The
       values "yes", "y", "1", or "true" will enable such an option and "no",
       "n", "0" or "false" will disable it.  Prior to the 2.5.2 release, these
       values were case sensitive.

       For other options, they generally take the same values as they do on
       the command line.  Though some options allow a slightly different
       format (e.g. --display-level).  These exceptions are explained for the
       relevant options in "OPTIONS".

       Beyond command line options, it is also allowed to specify the
       environment variable "TMPDIR" in the configuration file.

       A sample configuration file could look like:

        # Sample configuration file for lintian
        #
        # Set the default profile (--profile)
        LINTIAN_PROFILE = debian

        # Set the default TMPDIR for lintian to /var/tmp/lintian
        # - useful if /tmp is tmpfs with "limited" size.
        TMPDIR = /var/tmp/lintian/

        # Show info (I:) tags by default (--display-info)
        #  NB: this cannot be used with display-level
        display-info=yes

        # Ignore all overrides (--no-override)
        #  NB: called "override" in the config file
        #      and has inverted value!
        override = no

        # Automatically determine if color should be used
        color = auto

EXIT STATUS
       0   No policy violations or major errors detected.  (There may have
           been warnings, though.)

       1   Policy violations or major errors detected.

       2   Lintian run-time error. An error message is sent to stderr.

CHECKING LAST BUILD
       When run in an unpacked package dir (with no package selection
       arguments), Lintian will use debian/changelog to determine the source
       and version of the package.  Lintian will then attempt to find a
       matching .changes file for this source and version combination.

       Lintian will (in order) search the following directories:

       ..  Used by dpkg-buildpackage(1).

       ../build-area
           Used by svn-buildpackage(1).

       /var/cache/pbuilder/result
           Used by pbuilder(1) and cowbuilder(1).

       In each directory, Lintian will attempt to find a .changes file using
       the following values as architecture (in order):

       $DEB_BUILD_ARCH (or dpkg --print-architecture)
           The environment variable DEB_BUILD_ARCH (if not set, "dpkg
           --print-architecture" will be used instead)

       $DEB_HOST_ARCH
           The environment variable DEB_HOST_ARCH.

       dpkg --print-foreign-architectures
           If dpkg(1) appears to support multi-arch, then any architecture
           listed by "dpkg --print-foreign-architectures" will be used (in the
           order returned by dpkg).

       multi
           Pseudo architecture used by mergechanges(1).

       all Used when building architecture indep packages only (e.g.  dpkg-
           buildpackage -A).

       source
           Used for "source only" builds (e.g. dpkg-buildpackage -S).

       If a .changes file matches any combination above exists, Lintian will
       process the first match as if you had passed it per command line.  If
       no .changes file can be found, Lintian will print a list of attempted
       locations on STDERR and exit 0.

EXAMPLES
       $ lintian foo.changes
           Check the changes file itself and any (binary, udeb or source)
           package listed in it.

       $ lintian foo.deb
           Check binary package foo given by foo.deb.

       $ lintian foo.dsc
           Check source package foo given by foo.dsc.

       $ lintian foo.dsc -L +info
           Check source package foo given by foo.dsc, including info tags.

       $ lintian -i foo.changes
           Check the changes file and, if listed, the source and binary
           package of the upload. The output will contain detailed information
           about the reported tags.

       $ lintian
           Assuming debian/changelog exists, look for a changes file for the
           source in the parent dir.  Otherwise, print usage information and
           exit.

BUGS
       Lintian does not have any locking mechanisms yet.  (Running several
       Lintian processes on the same laboratory simultaneously is likely to
       fail or corrupt the laboratory.)
