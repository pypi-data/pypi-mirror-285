NAME
       mewl - Message scanner for Mew 4 or later

SYNOPSIS
       mewl [options] [folder [range]]

DESCRIPTION
       The  mewl  utility  extracts  necessary  fields from messages stored in
       folders.  This command is necessary for Mew to implement the  asynchro-
       nous feature.

       The options are as follows:

       -a      Print all necessary fields when picking.

       -b dir  Set the Mail home to dir.

       -c bodylen
               Set the max body length to be extracted to bodylen.

       -d field
               Set the field to be extracted to field.

       -e command
               Specify an external command to fetch mailbox.

       -m options
               Specify options for command.

       -f fields
               Specify fields to display.

       -h      Display this help message.

       -i file Set the input stream to file.

       -l length
               Set  the  max  field length to be extracted to length.  The de-
               fault value is 3. 0 means no limit.

       -n      Don't use fstat().

       -p pattern
               Specify the pick pattern.

       -s src  Set message source to src : '+folder range'.

       -w      Wait for stdio input to synchronize.

       -v      Display the version.

       -x suffix
               Use this suffix.

               Definitions of the symbols above are as follows:

       range   N | [start]-[end] | last:N

       pattern 'key=val' | 'key!=val' | '!<pattern>' | '(<pattern>)' |  '<pat-
               tern>&<pattern>' | '<pattern>|<pattern>'

BUGS
       If a field is long, only the beginning three lines are extracted by de-
       fault.
