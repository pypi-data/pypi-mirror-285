NAME
       systemd-inhibit - Execute a program with an inhibition lock taken

SYNOPSIS
       systemd-inhibit [OPTIONS...] [COMMAND] [ARGUMENTS...]

       systemd-inhibit [OPTIONS...] --list

DESCRIPTION
       systemd-inhibit may be used to execute a program with a shutdown,
       sleep, or idle inhibitor lock taken. The lock will be acquired before
       the specified command line is executed and released afterwards.

       Inhibitor locks may be used to block or delay system sleep and shutdown
       requests from the user, as well as automatic idle handling of the OS.
       This is useful to avoid system suspends while an optical disc is being
       recorded, or similar operations that should not be interrupted.

       For more information see the Inhibitor Lock Developer Documentation[1].

OPTIONS
       The following options are understood:

       --what=
           Takes a colon-separated list of one or more operations to inhibit:
           "shutdown", "sleep", "idle", "handle-power-key",
           "handle-suspend-key", "handle-hibernate-key", "handle-lid-switch",
           for inhibiting reboot/power-off/halt/kexec, suspending/hibernating,
           the automatic idle detection, or the low-level handling of the
           power/sleep key and the lid switch, respectively. If omitted,
           defaults to "idle:sleep:shutdown".

       --who=
           Takes a short, human-readable descriptive string for the program
           taking the lock. If not passed, defaults to the command line
           string.

       --why=
           Takes a short, human-readable descriptive string for the reason for
           taking the lock. Defaults to "Unknown reason".

       --mode=
           Takes either "block" or "delay" and describes how the lock is
           applied. If "block" is used (the default), the lock prohibits any
           of the requested operations without time limit, and only privileged
           users may override it. If "delay" is used, the lock can only delay
           the requested operations for a limited time. If the time elapses,
           the lock is ignored and the operation executed. The time limit may
           be specified in logind.conf(5). Note that "delay" is only available
           for "sleep" and "shutdown".

       --list
           Lists all active inhibition locks instead of acquiring one.

       --no-pager
           Do not pipe output into a pager.

       --no-legend
           Do not print the legend, i.e. column headers and the footer with
           hints.

       -h, --help
           Print a short help text and exit.

       --version
           Print a short version string and exit.

EXIT STATUS
       Returns the exit status of the executed program.

EXAMPLE
           # systemd-inhibit wodim foobar.iso

       This burns the ISO image foobar.iso on a CD using wodim(1), and
       inhibits system sleeping, shutdown and idle while doing so.

ENVIRONMENT
       $SYSTEMD_PAGER
           Pager to use when --no-pager is not given; overrides $PAGER. If
           neither $SYSTEMD_PAGER nor $PAGER are set, a set of well-known
           pager implementations are tried in turn, including less(1) and
           more(1), until one is found. If no pager implementation is
           discovered no pager is invoked. Setting this environment variable
           to an empty string or the value "cat" is equivalent to passing
           --no-pager.

       $SYSTEMD_LESS
           Override the options passed to less (by default "FRSXMK").

           Users might want to change two options in particular:

           K
               This option instructs the pager to exit immediately when Ctrl+C
               is pressed. To allow less to handle Ctrl+C itself to switch
               back to the pager command prompt, unset this option.

               If the value of $SYSTEMD_LESS does not include "K", and the
               pager that is invoked is less, Ctrl+C will be ignored by the
               executable, and needs to be handled by the pager.

           X
               This option instructs the pager to not send termcap
               initialization and deinitialization strings to the terminal. It
               is set by default to allow command output to remain visible in
               the terminal even after the pager exits. Nevertheless, this
               prevents some pager functionality from working, in particular
               paged output cannot be scrolled with the mouse.

           See less(1) for more discussion.

       $SYSTEMD_LESSCHARSET
           Override the charset passed to less (by default "utf-8", if the
           invoking terminal is determined to be UTF-8 compatible).

       $SYSTEMD_COLORS
           The value must be a boolean. Controls whether colorized output
           should be generated. This can be specified to override the decision
           that systemd makes based on $TERM and what the console is connected
           to.

       $SYSTEMD_URLIFY
           The value must be a boolean. Controls whether clickable links
           should be generated in the output for terminal emulators supporting
           this. This can be specified to override the decision that systemd
           makes based on $TERM and other conditions.
