NAME
       chklref - manual page for chklref 3.1.2

SYNOPSIS
       chklref [options] texfile

DESCRIPTION
       Check unused labels and bibitems in a LaTeX file

OPTIONS
       --tex <compiler>, -t
              Specify the TeX compiler to be used. Default is `pdflatex`.

       --tex-options
              List  of  options  to  pass  to the TeX compiler. It should be a
              quoted string of white space delimited options. Note that we al-
              ways add `-interaction nonstopmode` on top of these options.

       --debug, -d
              Run in debug mode. Do not clean the generated `.chk` file.

       --quiet, -q
              Run in quiet mode. Do not print the output of the TeX compiler.

       --parse-only
              Do  not  run  the  LaTeX  compiler  but use the already existing
              `.chk` file.  When this option is passed,  the  following  other
              options  are  meaningless:  `--tex`, `--tex-options`, `--quiet`,
              `--debug`.

       --version, -v
              Print the version of this script.

       --help,h
              Print this help.
