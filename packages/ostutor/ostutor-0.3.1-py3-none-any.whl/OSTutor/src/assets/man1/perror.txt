NAME
       perror - display MySQL error message information

SYNOPSIS
       perror [options] errorcode ...

DESCRIPTION
       perror displays the error message for MySQL or operating system error
       codes. Invoke perror like this:

           perror [options] errorcode ...

       perror attempts to be flexible in understanding its arguments. For
       example, for the ER_WRONG_VALUE_FOR_VAR error, perror understands any
       of these arguments: 1231, 001231, MY-1231, or MY-001231, or
       ER_WRONG_VALUE_FOR_VAR.

           $> perror 1231
           MySQL error code MY-001231 (ER_WRONG_VALUE_FOR_VAR): Variable '%-.64s'
           can't be set to the value of '%-.200s'

       If an error number is in the range where MySQL and operating system
       errors overlap, perror displays both error messages:

           $> perror 1 13
           OS error code   1:  Operation not permitted
           MySQL error code MY-000001: Can't create/write to file '%s' (OS errno %d - %s)
           OS error code  13:  Permission denied
           MySQL error code MY-000013: Can't get stat of '%s' (OS errno %d - %s)

       To obtain the error message for a MySQL Cluster error code, use the
       ndb_perror utility.

       The meaning of system error messages may be dependent on your operating
       system. A given error code may mean different things on different
       operating systems.

       perror supports the following options.

       o   --help, --info, -I, -?  Display a help message and exit.

       o   --ndb Print the error message for a MySQL Cluster error code.

           This option was removed in MySQL 8.0.13. Use the ndb_perror utility
           instead.

       o   --silent, -s Silent mode. Print only the error message.

       o   --verbose, -v Verbose mode. Print error code and message. This is
           the default behavior.

       o   --version, -V Display version information and exit.
