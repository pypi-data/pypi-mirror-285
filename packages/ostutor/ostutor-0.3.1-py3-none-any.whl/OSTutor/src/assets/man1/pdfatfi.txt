NAME
       pdfatfi - Help program for the LaTeX package attachfile2.

SYNOPSIS
       pdfatfi <command> [<options>] <file[.atfi]>]

DESCRIPTION
       Helper program for the LaTeX package attachfile2.

       This  package  also tries to get and add meta information data, such as
       file size, file date, checksum, ....

       The script pdfatfi.pl is provided for use with old versions  of  pdfTeX
       and XeTeX that do not provide access to  file metadata.

       The  use of the Perl script is not mandatory. This data can be shown by
       PDF viewers, but they are not a requirement of the PDF specification.

       Package attachfile2 and the Perl script communicate  via  an  auxiliary
       file  with  file  extension .atfi. The script is used between two LaTeX
       runs and updates the auxiliary file.
