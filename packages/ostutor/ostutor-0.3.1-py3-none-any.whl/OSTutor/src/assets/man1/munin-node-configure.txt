NAME
       munin-node-configure - View and modify which plugins are enabled.

SYNOPSIS
         munin-node-configure [options]

DESCRIPTION
       munin-node-configure reports which plugins are enabled on the current
       node, and suggest changes to this list.

       By default this program shows which plugins are activated on the
       system.

       If you specify "--suggest", it will present a table of plugins that
       will probably work (according to the plugins' autoconf command).

       If you specify "--snmp", followed by a list of hosts, it will present a
       table of SNMP plugins that they support.

       If you additionally specify "--shell", shell commands to install those
       same plugins will be printed. These can be reviewed or piped directly
       into a shell to install the plugins.

OPTIONS
       --help
           Show this help page.

       --version
           Show version information.

       --debug
           Print debug information on the operations of
           "munin-node-configure".  This can be very verbose.

           All debugging output is printed to STDOUT, and each line is
           prefixed with '#'.  Only errors are printed to STDERR.

       --pidebug
           Plugin debug.  Sets the environment variable MUNIN_DEBUG to 1 so
           that plugins may enable debugging.

       --config <file>
           Override configuration file [/etc/munin/munin-node.conf]

       --servicedir <dir>
           Override plugin directory [/etc/munin/plugins/]

       --sconfdir <dir>
           Override plugin configuration directory [/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/]

       --libdir <dir>
           Override plugin library [/usr/share/munin/plugins/]

       --exitnoterror
           Do not consider plugins that exit non-zero exit-value as error.

       --suggest
           Suggest plugins that might be added or removed, instead of those
           that are currently enabled.

   OUTPUT OPTIONS
       By default, "munin-node-configure" will print out a table summarising
       the results.

       --shell
           Instead of a table, print shell commands to install the new plugin
           suggestions.

           This implies "--suggest", unless "--snmp" was also enabled.  By
           default, it will not attempt to remove any plugins.

       --remove-also
           When "--shell" is enabled, also provide commands to remove plugins
           that are no longer applicable from the service directory.

   PLUGIN SELECTION OPTIONS
       --families <family,...>
           Override the list of families that will be used (auto, manual,
           contrib, snmpauto).  Multiple families can be specified as a comma-
           separated list, by repeating the "--families" option, or as a
           combination of the two.

           When listing installed plugins, the default families are 'auto',
           'manual' and 'contrib'.  Only 'auto' plugins are checked for
           suggestions.  SNMP probing is only performed on 'snmpauto' plugins.

       --newer <version>
           Only consider plugins added to the Munin core since <version>.
           This option is useful when upgrading, since it can prevent plugins
           that have been manually removed from being reinstalled.  This only
           applies to plugins in the 'auto' family.

   SNMP Options
       --snmp <host|cidr,...>
           Probe the SNMP agents on the host or CIDR network (e.g.
           "192.168.1.0/24"), to see what plugins they support. This may take
           some time, especially if the many hosts are specified.

           This option can be specified multiple times, or as a comma-
           separated list, to include more than one host/CIDR.

       --snmpversion <ver>
           The SNMP version (1, 2c or 3) to use. ['2c']

       --snmpport <port>
           The SNMP port to use [161]

       --snmpdomain <domain>
           The Transport Domain to use for exchanging SNMP messages. The
           default is UDP/IPv4. Possible values: 'udp', 'udp4', 'udp/ipv4';
           'udp6', 'udp/ipv6'; 'tcp', 'tcp4', 'tcp/ipv4'; 'tcp6', 'tcp/ipv6'.

       SNMP 1/2c authentication
           SNMP versions 1 and 2c use a "community string" for authentication.
           This is a shared password, sent in plaintext over the network.

       --snmpcommunity <string>
           The community string for version 1 and 2c agents.  ['public'] (If
           this works your device is probably very insecure and needs a
           security checkup).

       SNMP 3 authentication
           SNMP v3 has three security levels. Lowest is "noAuthNoPriv", which
           provides neither authentication nor encryption.  If a username and
           "authpassword" are given it goes up to "authNoPriv", and the
           connection is authenticated.  If "privpassword" is also given the
           security level becomes "authPriv", and the connection is
           authenticated and encrypted.

           Note: Encryption can slow down slow or heavily loaded network
           devices.  For most uses "authNoPriv" will be secure enough -- the
           password is sent over the network encrypted in any case.

           ContextEngineIDs are not (yet) supported.

           For further reading on SNMP v3 security models please consult
           RFC3414 and the documentation for Net::SNMP.

       --snmpusername <name>
           Username.  There is no default.

       --snmpauthpassword <password>
           Authentication password.  Optional when encryption is also enabled,
           in which case defaults to the privacy password
           ("--snmpprivpassword").

       --snmpauthprotocol <protocol>
           Authentication protocol.  One of 'md5' or 'sha' (HMAC-MD5-96,
           RFC1321 and SHA-1/HMAC-SHA-96, NIST FIPS PIB 180, RFC2264).
           ['md5']

       --snmpprivpassword <password>
           Privacy password to enable encryption.  There is no default.  An
           empty ('') password is considered as no password and will not
           enable encryption.

           Privacy requires a privprotocol as well as an authprotocol and a
           authpassword, but all of these are defaulted (to 'des', 'md5', and
           the privpassword value, respectively) and may therefore be left
           unspecified.

       --snmpprivprotocol <protocol>
           If the privpassword is set this setting controls what kind of
           encryption is used to achieve privacy in the session.  Only the
           very weak 'des' encryption method is supported officially.  ['des']

           munin-node-configure also supports '3des' (CBC-3DES-EDE, aka
           Triple-DES, NIST FIPS 46-3) as specified in IETF
           draft-reeder-snmpv3-usm-3desede.  Whether or not this works with
           any particular device, we do not know.
