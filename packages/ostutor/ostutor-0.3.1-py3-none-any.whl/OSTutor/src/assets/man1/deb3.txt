NAME
       deb3 - convert debian source package to new 3.0 (quilt) format

SYNOPSIS
       deb3 [quilt|dpatch|0|1|2]

DESCRIPTION
       deb3  converts  debian source packages which use series of patches from
       1.0 format to new 3.0 (quilt) format while adjusting  contents  in  de-
       bian/patches.   This  is  run from the package top level directory.  If
       run without argument, deb3 guesses source structure.  Following formats
       are auto detected.

       o  dh_quilt_patch/dh_quilt_unpatch

       o  dpatch

       o  cdbs (simple-patchsys.mk)

       o  dbs (dbs-build.mk)

ARGUMENT
       You can force particular conversion using argument.

       quilt     conversion for dh_quilt_patch/dh_quilt_unpatch

       dpatch    conversion for dpatch

       0         conversion for dbs and cdbs made with -p 0 patches (default)

       1         conversion for dbs and cdbs made with -p 1 patches

       2         conversion for dbs and cdbs made with -p 2 patches

TERMINATING THE CONVERSION
       This  deb3 program only provides a starting point. After its execution,
       further modifications are needed to your package. Typical changes are:

       o  Build-Depends: you should remove cdbs, dpatch and  quilt.   Instead,
          you should add debhelper (>= 7.0.50~)

       o  Add override_dh_* targets to debian/rules to address special cases.

       o  Remove --with quilt from the debian/rules, if it uses the dh $@ syn-
          tax.

       You can find tutorial for packaging using this new dh $@ style and  new
       3.0  (quilt)  source  format  in  the  maint-guide package.  It is also
       available at:
