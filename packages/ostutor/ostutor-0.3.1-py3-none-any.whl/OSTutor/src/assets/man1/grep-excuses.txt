NAME
       grep-excuses  -  search  the testing excuses files for a specific main-
       tainer

SYNOPSIS
       grep-excuses [options] [maintainer|package]

DESCRIPTION
       grep-excuses downloads the autoremovals and  update_excuses.html  files
       and  greps them for the specified maintainer or package name.  The wget
       package is required for this script.  If no name is given on  the  com-
       mand  line, first the environment variable DEBFULLNAME is used if it is
       defined, and failing that, the configuration variable  described  below
       is used.

OPTIONS
       --no-conf, --noconf
              Do  not  read any configuration files.  This can only be used as
              the first option given on the command-line.

       --wipnity, -w
              Get  information  from  <https://qa.debian.org/excuses.php>.   A
              package name must be given when using this option.

       --help Show a brief usage message.

       --version
              Show version and copyright information.

       --autopkgtests
              Investigate  and  show  autopkgtest  (ci.debian.net) failures in
              your packages but apparently caused by  new  versions  of  other
              packages  trying  to migrate.  (--no-autopkgtests can be used to
              override GREP_EXCUSES_AUTOPKGTESTS.)

       --no-autoremovals
              Investigate and show only testing propagation excuses,  not  au-
              toremovals.

       --debug
              Print debugging output to stderr (including url(s) fetched).

CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
       The  two configuration files /etc/devscripts.conf and ~/.devscripts are
       sourced in that order to set configuration variables.  Command line op-
       tions can be used to override configuration file settings.  Environment
       variable settings are ignored for this purpose.  The  currently  recog-
       nised variable is:

       GREP_EXCUSES_MAINTAINER
              The  default maintainer, email or package to grep for if none is
              specified on the command line.

       GREP_EXCUSES_AUTOPKGTESTS
              Boolean: whether to show autopkgtest failures in other packages.
              See --autopkgtests.
