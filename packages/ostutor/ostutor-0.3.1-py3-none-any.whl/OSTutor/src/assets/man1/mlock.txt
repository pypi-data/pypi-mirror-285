NAME
       mlock -- lock a mailbox

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/bin/mlock

DESCRIPTION
       If libc-client.so is unable to create a mailbox lock file, it will call
       this program.  This makes using the mailbox safe over i.e. NFS. There
       is no reason to call mlock yourself or through another program.  It is
       setgid mail so there is no need to change the permissions of /var/mail
       to 1777.

BUGS
       No documentation other than this crappy man page,
