NAME
       ppltotf, uppltotf - Create Japanese pTeX font metric (JFM)

SYNOPSIS
       ppltotf [options] pl_file_name[.pl] [tfm_file_name[.tfm]]

DESCRIPTION
       The ppltotf program translates a Japanese property list (JPL) file to a
       Japanese pTeX font metric (JFM) file.  The resulting JFM  file  can  be
       used with pTeX and e-pTeX.

       The  uppltotf program is a Unicode-enabled version of ppltotf.  The re-
       sulting JFM file can be used with upTeX and e-upTeX.

       In the following sections, we refer to these programs as (u)ppltotf.

       (u)ppltotf is upper compatible with pltotf; if the input PL file is for
       roman  fonts,  it  is translated into an ordinary TeX font metric (TFM)
       file.  The difference between ppltotf and uppltotf lies in  the  output
       encoding:  ppltotf  always  outputs JIS-encoded JFM; on the other hand,
       uppltotf outputs Unicode-encoded JFM by default.

OPTIONS
       Compared to pltotf, the following option is added to (u)ppltotf.

       -kanji string
              Sets the input Japanese Kanji code.  The string can  be  one  of
              the       followings:      euc (EUC-JP),      jis (ISO-2022-JP),
              sjis (Shift_JIS), utf8 (UTF-8), uptex (UTF-8; uppltotf only).

       When one of euc, jis, sjis or utf8 is specified, both ppltotf  and  up-
       pltotf  output  a  JIS-encoded  JFM.   When uptex is specified with up-
       pltotf, it outputs a Unicode-encoded JFM.
