NAME
       sgmlspl - a simple post-processor for onsgmls/nsgmls

SYNOPSIS
       sgmlspl spec file

DESCRIPTION
       sgmlspl is a sample application to convert SGML documents to other for-
       mats by providing a specification file detailing exactly how to  handle
       each  element,  external data entity, subdocument entity, CDATA string,
       record end, SDATA string, and processing instruction.

       To use sgmlspl, prepare a specification file containing  regular  perl5
       code.  If the SGML document were named doc.sgml, the sgmlspl specifica-
       tion file were named, spec.pl, and  the  name  of  the  new  file  were
       doc.latex,  then  use  the following command in a Unix shell to convert
       the SGML document:

       onsgmls doc.sgml | sgmlspl spec.pl > doc.latex

       sgmlspl will pass any additional  arguments  on  to  the  specification
       file, which can then process them in the regular perl5 fashion.
