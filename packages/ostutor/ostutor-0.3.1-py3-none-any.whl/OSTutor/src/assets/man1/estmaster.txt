NAME
       estmaster - master process of node servers

SYNOPSIS
       estmaster init [-ex] rootdir

       estmaster start [-bg] [-ro] [-st] rootdir

       estmaster stop rootdir

       estmaster unittest rootdir

       estmaster crypt key [hash]

DESCRIPTION
       estmaster is an aggregation of sub commands.  The name of a sub command
       is specified by the first argument.  Other arguments are parsed accord-
       ing  to  each  sub  command.  The argument rootdir specifies the server
       root directory which contains configuration file and so on.

       estmaster init [-ex] rootdir
              Create the server root directory.
              If -ex is specified, some users and some nodes are set for exam-
              ple.   By default, only a super user whose name and password are
              both "admin" is set.

       estmaster start [-bg] [-ro] [-st] rootdir
              Start the node master.
              If -bg is specified, the server runs in background as  a  daemon
              process.
              If  -ro  is specified, the server runs in read-only mode regard-
              less of the configuration.
              If -st is specified, the server runs in single thread mode.

       estmaster stop rootdir
              Stop the running node master.

       estmaster unittest rootdir
              Perform unit tests.

       estmaster crypt key [hash]
              Output an encrypted string of a string.
              key specifies a target string.
              If hash is specified, it checks whether the  key  and  the  hash
              matches.

       All  sub  commands return 0 if the operation is success, else return 1.
       A running node master  finishes  with  closing  the  database  when  it
       catches  the  signal  1  (SIGHUP),  2  (SIGINT),  3  (SIGQUIT),  or  15
       (SIGTERM).  Moreover, when a node master running as  a  daemon  catches
       the signal 1 (SIGHUP), the process is re-start and re-read the configu-
       ration files.

       A running node server should be finished by valid means by command line
       or via network.  Otherwise, the index may be broken.
