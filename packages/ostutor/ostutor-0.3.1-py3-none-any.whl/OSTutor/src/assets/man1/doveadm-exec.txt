       doveadm-exec - easily execute commands from Dovecot's libexec_dir

       doveadm [-Dv] exec binary [binary arguments]

DESCRIPTION
       This  command  allows  administrators and local users to simply execute
       commands from within libexec_dir.  So for example a  logged  in  system
       user  could  start a pre-authenticated imap session, using the command:
       doveadm exec imap.  An administrator would  use  the  command:  doveadm
       exec imap -u username.

              override  multiple settings, the -o option may be specified mul-
              tiple times.

       -v     Enables verbosity, including progress counter.
