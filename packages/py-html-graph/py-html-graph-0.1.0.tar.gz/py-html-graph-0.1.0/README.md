# py-html-graph

This is a library for showing graphs in browser when we want to draw something in python, a good supplement for the awful and annoying matplotlib.

You can dynamically zoom and pan the graph, without the need to generate the image again. With a much faster speed and higher resolution than matplotlib.

Currently it will support line chart (over time) (with multiple variables) and depth graph (over price).

Will optimize for large amount of data, with a frequent exchange between frontend and backend.

This library is still being developed in progress, and I will provide the docs and usage as long as it is finished.
