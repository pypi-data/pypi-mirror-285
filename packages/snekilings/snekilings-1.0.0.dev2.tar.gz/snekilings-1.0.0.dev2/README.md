## The problem.
Learning Python involves **actually** doing things practically; sitting down and watching YouTube tutorial after another won't get you anywhere. Beginners tend to fall into this, we even have a name for it, Tutorial 🔥 Hell. Tutorials are good for getting to know the basics but that's where I believe you should stop, and begin actually writing code.

🐍 Snekilings helps with 🌟 that. 🐍 Snakelings provides a set of short exercises to immerse you into developing and debugging Python code. Inspired by [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings), each exercise in Snakelings has intentional faults designed to expose you to as many Python exceptions and errors as possible. 🐍 Snakelings bridges the gap between the theoretical and practical coding knowledge by providing a **real** environment.

## TODO
- [x] Print markdown to terminal.
- [x] Pytest intergraion (some exercises will make use of pytest to test the anwsers/values)
- [x] Command to update exercises folder with new exercises.
- [ ] More appropriate exercises...

*and more to be added*
