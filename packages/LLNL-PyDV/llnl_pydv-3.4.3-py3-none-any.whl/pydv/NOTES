   Redefined norm so it does not divide by the interval.  This
   definition is more  consistent with usual mathematical 
   definitions of norm. Also, fixed bug in integrate() where if 
   either xmin or xmax were zero, then the user supplied interval 
   was ignored.

   Added ability to change width of label column, upgraded regex
   syntax documentation.

2012/11/12
   Made linespoints show up as o-o in the legend rather than -o-.

2012/09/04
   Added 'linespoints' mode for curves.  Syntax like the 'scatter'
   mode command.

   Ticks pretty much good, Owen added headerless reads.  Clear that 
   we need a re-factoring of the code, several missed opportunities 
   for encapsulation exist.
