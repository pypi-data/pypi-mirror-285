0.2.4

0.2.3
#####

* Fixed handling of the epilog

0.2.2
#####

* CommonMark is now only imported if absolutely required. This should fix failures on read the docs. Thanks to @Chilipp for fixing this!

0.2.1
#####

* Stopped importing `sphinx.util.compat`, which was causing issues like that seen in `#65 <https://github.com/alex-rudakov/sphinx-argparse/issues/65>`_

0.2.0
#####

* Section titles can now be used in tables of contents and linked to. The title itself is also used as the anchor. In the case of repeated names `_replicateX`, where `X` is a number, is prepended to ensure that all titles are uniquely linkable. This was bug `#46 <https://github.com/alex-rudakov/sphinx-argparse/issues/46>`_.
* The positional (aka required) and named (aka optional) option sections are now named "Positional Arguments" and "Named Arguments", for the sake of clarity (e.g., named arguments can be required). This was issue `#58 <https://github.com/alex-rudakov/sphinx-argparse/issues/58>`_.
* Fixed quoting of default strings (issue `#59 <https://github.com/alex-rudakov/sphinx-argparse/issues/59>`_).
* Added the `:noepilog:` and `:nodescription:` options, thanks to @arewm.
* Added the `:nosubcommand:` option, thanks to @arewm.

0.1.17
######

* Fixed handling of argument groups (this was bug `#49 <https://github.com/alex-rudakov/sphinx-argparse/issues/49>`_). Thanks to @croth1 for reporting this bug. Note that now position arguments (also known as required arguments) within argument groups are now also handled correctly.

0.1.16
######

* Added a `:nodefaultconst:` directive, which is similar to the `:nodefault:` directive, but applies only to `store_true`, `store_false`, and `store_const` (e.g., it will hide the "=True" part in the output, since that can be misleading to users).
* Fixed various typos (thanks to users mikeantonacci, brondsem, and tony)
* Format specifiers (e.g., `%(prog)s` and `%(default)s`) are now filled in (if possible) in help sections. If there's a missing keyword, then nothing will be filled in. This was issue #27.
* The package is now a bit more robust to incorrectly spelling module names (#39, courtesy of Gabriel Falc√£o)
* Added support for argparse groups (thanks to Fidel Ramirez)
