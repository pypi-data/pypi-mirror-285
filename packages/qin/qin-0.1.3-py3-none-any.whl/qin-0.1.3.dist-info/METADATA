# Interesting Toolset Script

[中文说明文档](./README/zh-CN.md)

Given the frequent need for various small tools, I plan to create a script library. Currently, it only supports CLI.

> [!warning]
> Since I use a Mac, this project is currently only usable on Mac. Other platforms have not been tested yet. If you encounter any issues, please submit an issue.

> [!note]
> This project relies on ffmpeg. Please ensure ffmpeg is installed locally.

## Some Project Configurations

- The default configuration file is `~/.qin/config.json`.
