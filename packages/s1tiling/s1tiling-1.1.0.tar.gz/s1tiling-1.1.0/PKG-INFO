On demand Ortho-rectification of Sentinel-1 data on Sentinel-2 grid.

Sentinel-1 is currently the only system to provide SAR images regularly on all
lands on the planet. Access to these time series of images opens an
extraordinary range of applications. In order to meet the needs of a large
number of users, including our needs, we have created an automatic processing
chain to generate _"Analysis Ready"_ time series for a very large number of
applications.

With __S1Tiling__, Sentinel-1 data is ortho-rectified on the Sentinel-2 grid to promote joint use
of both missions.

__S1Tiling__ was developed within the CNES radar service, in collaboration with
CESBIO, to generate time series of calibrated, ortho-rectified and filtered
Sentinel-1 images on any lands on the Earth. The tool benefits for the SAR
ortho-rectification application
[from the Orfeo Tool Box](https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/).

The resulting images are registered to Sentinel-2 L2 optical images, using the
same MGRS geographic reference grid ([S2 tiling system - kml file](https://sentinel.esa.int/documents/247904/1955685/S2A_OPER_GIP_TILPAR_MPC__20151209T095117_V20150622T000000_21000101T000000_B00.kml)).
This Python software, is based on the Orfeo Tool Box (OTB) image processing
library, developed by CNES. Different Sentinel-1 data providers can be used
like [PEPS](https://peps.cnes.f) or
[Copernicus Scihub](https://scihub.copernicus.eu).
It can be used on any type of platform, from a large computing cluster to a
laptop (the fan will make some noise during processing). It is considerably
faster than the ortho-rectification tool in SNAP, and can be easily used in
script form.

S1Tiling is currently used for many applications, such deforestation detection
in the Amazon, monitoring of rice crops in Southeast Asia or monitoring of
water stocks in India. In addition, this software is accessible as an on-demand
processing service on the French PEPS collaborative ground segment, in order to
make it easier for users to use.

The reference documentation is provided at
https://s1-tiling.pages.orfeo-toolbox.org/s1tiling/latest. And the source code
is always available at https://gitlab.orfeo-toolbox.org/s1-tiling/s1tiling.

# Installation

S1Tiling installation has a few traps. Please read the [relevant documentation](https://s1-tiling.pages.orfeo-toolbox.org/s1tiling/latest/install.html)
regarding OTB and GDAL installation.

## Requirements

* OTB 7.4
* GDAL with python bindings as well
* Python 3
  * click
  * eodag
  * numpy
  * gdal
  * yaml
  * Dask"distributed"
  * bokeh (to display Dask dashboard)
  * graphviz (to generate task graphs)

### Dask
> Dask does not require any setup if you only want to use it on a single computer.
