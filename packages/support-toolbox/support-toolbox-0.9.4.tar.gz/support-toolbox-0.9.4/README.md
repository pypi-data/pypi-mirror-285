## Using a Tool for the First Time
When using these tools for the first time, you will encounter two types of tokens: permanent and runtime.

### Permanent Tokens
During the initial setup, you'll be prompted to provide these tokens for specific tools. If you make a mistake during this setup, don't worry; you can reset your tokens.

To reset your tokens:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Use the `cd` command to navigate to your Home directory:

  ```bash
   cd ~
   ```
3. Run the following command to reset your tokens:


  ```bash
  rm -rf .tokens.ini
  ```
This command will remove the token file, allowing you to reconfigure your tokens when you launch the tool again.
