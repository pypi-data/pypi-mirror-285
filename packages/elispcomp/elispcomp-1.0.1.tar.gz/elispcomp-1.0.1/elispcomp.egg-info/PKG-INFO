# elispcomp - Compiling Emacs Lisp code from the command-line

The `elispcomp` command-line tool allows compiling Elisp (Emacs Lisp) code efficiently, providing optimized .elc and .eln files for improved performance in Emacs.

This tool simplifies the compilation of Emacs Lisp (Elisp) code by generating optimized .elc and .eln files directly from the command-line. Utilizing Emacs, it recursively compiles all Elisp files within a specified directory. The tool supports various compilation configurations, enabling users to adapt the process to their specific needs.

With an emphasis on simplicity and efficiency, it offers a powerful solution for managing and optimizing Emacs Lisp codebases from the command-line.

## Installation

Here is how to install `elispcomp` using pip:
```
pip install --user elispcomp
```

The pip command above will install the `elispcomp` executable in the directory `~/.local/bin/`.

## Usage

Here is an example of how to byte-compile and native-compile all .el files located in the `~/.emacs.d/lisp` directory. The native-compiled files will be stored in the `~/.eln-cache` directory:
```
elispcomp --eln-cache-dir ~/.eln-cache ~/.emacs.d/lisp
```

The available options are as follows:
```
usage: elispcomp [--option] [N]

Recursively byte and native compile .el files.

positional arguments:
  N                     The directories to be scanned recursively by Emacs to locate the '.el' files for compilation.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c ELN_CACHE_DIR, --eln-cache-dir ELN_CACHE_DIR
                        The eln-cache directory where Emacs stores the compiled native compiled code. Defaults to the default Emacs eln-cache directory.
  -e EMACS_BIN, --emacs-bin EMACS_BIN
                        Path to the Emacs binary. Defaults: emacs
  -j JOBS, --jobs JOBS  Specify the number of parallel jobs for compilation. Default: Half the number of available CPUs
  -b, --disable-byte-comp
                        Disable byte-compile. Default: enabled
  -n, --disable-native-comp
                        Disable native compilation. Default: enabled
```
