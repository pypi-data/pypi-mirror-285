        "question": "The Organisation that allows a community to influence their operation or use and to enjoy the benefits arisingwas founded in what year?",
        "context": "Enjoy the Arts is a 501(c) nonprofit organization located in Cincinnati, Ohio. Founded in 1981 by socialite Irma Lazarus and Phyllis Weston, Enjoy the Arts aimed to connect young audiences with Cincinnati's arts, culture and entertainment. In 2017, Enjoy the Arts merged with ArtsWave, Greater Cincinnati's local arts agency and the nation's first and largest community campaign for the arts.\r\nThe .338-06 is a wildcat cartridge based on the .30-06. It allows heavier .338 caliber bullets to be used from the .30-06 non-belted case. This is a better choice for heavy bodied game such as moose, elk, and brown bear than the .30-06. 338 caliber bullets became more widely available after the introduction in the late 1950s of the .338 Winchester Magnum cartridge, frequently chambered in the Winchester Model 70 rifle. The .338-06 maintains much of the benefits of the .338 Magnum cartridge but has substantially less recoil, makes more efficient use of powder, and allows use of widely available .30-06 commercial and military cases. It is similar in concept to the .333 OKH as well as the .35 Whelen, which also use the .30-06 brass case as a basis for the cartridge. Thanks to the large number of rifles based on the .30-06 family of cartridges, having a .338-06 made usually only requires a simple barrel change by a competent gun smith. A-Square adopted the caliber as the .338-06 A-Square in approximately 1998, and was approved by SAAMI as a standardized caliber. Weatherby offered factory rifles and ammunition, but has now dropped the rifles from its inventory. The 338-06 A-Square tends to have a velocity advantage over the .35 Whelen and uses bullets that retain velocity and resist wind drift better than similar weight bullets fired from the .35 Whelen.\r\nA special needs trust is a trust designed for beneficiaries with disabilities, either physically or mentally challenged. It is written so the beneficiary can enjoy the use of property that is held in the trust for his or her benefit, while at the same time allowing the beneficiary to receive essential needs-based government benefits. In addition to the public benefits preservation reasons for such a trust, there will be administrative advantages of using a trust to hold and manage property intended for the benefit of the beneficiary if the beneficiary lacks the legal capacity to handle his or her own financial affairs. Special needs trusts are sometimes known as supplemental needs trusts in the United States.\r\nCommunity owned assets or organisations are those that are owned and controlled through some representative mechanism that allows a community to influence their operation or use and to enjoy the benefits arising.\r\nThe Central Kentucky Youth Orchestras (CKYO) is a youth orchestra founded in 1947 by Howard Pence and based in Lexington, Kentucky. CKYO has a storied tradition and is dedicated to the musical education and growth of its student members. It is one of the oldest independently chartered youth orchestra in the United States. Over 400 students from 15 counties and 60 area schools participate in CKYO. CKYO has performed at the Singletary Center for the Arts on the University of Kentucky campus, the Lyric Theatre and Cultural Arts Center, the Lexington Opera House in downtown Lexington, and other venues around the state. Children's concerts and benefits for community organizations and businesses are also part of each season for CKYO. Orchestra members enjoy a major performance tour every three years; in the summer of 2008, CKYO performed concerts in Portugal and Spain. CKYO offers six orchestras; Symphony, Concert, Repertory, Preparatory Strings, Jazz Arts, and Jazz Repertory, as well as three community initiatives CKYO in the Schools, Friends in Music, and North Limestone MusicWorks.\r\nA predictive marker is a particular protein or gene that indicates sensitivity or resistance to a specific therapy. The use of predictive markers is becoming increasingly relevant in cancer therapy as it allows for better identification of patients who will respond positively to the therapy. In the clinical setting, predictive markers are limited to use in breast cancer. Expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors can determine the benefits of hormone therapy, whilst the benefit of treating breast cancer patients with herceptin (Trastuzumab) is determined by the expression of HER2. There are many advantages to utilizing a predictive marker in cancer therapy including better patient management minimizing unnecessary suffering from side effects with ultimately the wrong treatment choice, reducing loss of precious time whilst determining whether a therapy will provide any benefit, and a reduction in cost to both the patient and the wider health community.\r\nCommunity Land Scotland is a charity and membership organisation for community landowners and aspiring community landowners. It was founded in 2010 to represent the interests of community landowners, promote legislation which empowers communities and provide a point of contact for community bodies interested in community land ownership.\r\nThe Columbia River Treaty is a 1964 agreement between Canada and the United States on the development and operation of dams in the upper Columbia River basin for power and flood control benefits in both countries. Four dams were constructed under this treaty: three in British Columbia, Canada (Duncan Dam, Mica Dam, Keenleyside Dam) and one in Montana in the United States (Libby Dam). The treaty provided for the sharing with Canada of one-half of the downstream U.S. power and flood benefits, and allows the operation of Treaty storage for other benefits. The long-term impacts of the treaty have been mixed: while the dams have provided enormous economic benefits to British Columbia and the U.S. Pacific Northwest through hydroelectric generation and flood control, there are longstanding concerns regarding social and economic impacts to the local communities, and the environmental effects associated with the construction and operation of large dams.\r\nEmployee voice refers to the participation of employees in influencing organisational decision making. Because research and analysis have grown around the voice concept in a variety of disciplines, \u2018employee voice\u2019 has become an elastic term meaning somewhat different things to different policy, academic and practitioner actors . In the many disciplines that cover voice, such as human resource management, political science, economics, organisational behaviour, psychology or law, perspectives toward the concept differ. Drawing on Dundon et al. voice can be seen with different lenses. First, voice is an articulation of individual dissatisfaction or concern that aims to address a specific problem or issue with management. Second, voice takes the form of collective organisation, where voice provides a countervailing source of power to management. Third, there is the role of voice as a contribution to management decision-making. Here the purpose is to gain employee input to improve work organisation and efficiency more generally, perhaps through quality circles or teamwork, or eliciting workforce engagement. Fourth voice can be seen as an instrument for mutual gain, with productive collaboration between capital and labour increasing the long-term viability of an organisation and economic well-being of employees The editors of the Elgar Handbook of Employee Voice define employee voice as the ways and means through which employees attempt to have a say and potentially influence organisational affairs about issues that affect their work and the interests of managers and owners. This definition combines a variety of voice mechanisms that analysts often group in separate boxes (e.g. involvement or bargaining; union and non-union). It allows for employer implemented Non-union Employee Representative (NER) systems as a collective form of voice, be it chosen to marginalise a union presence or to provide an alternative to union influence In general, employee voice is about how employees are able to have a say over work activities and decisions within the organizations in which they work, regardless of the institutional channel through which it operates\u2014whether through speak-up programmes, quality circles, teamwork, or collective negotiation.\r\nIn biology, optimality models are a tool used to evaluate the costs and benefits of different organismal features, traits, and characteristics, including behavior, in the natural world. This evaluation allows researchers to make predictions about an organisms\u2019s optimal behavior or other aspects of its phenotype. Optimality modeling is the modeling aspect of optimization theory. It allows for the calculation and visualization of the costs and benefits that influence the outcome of a decision, and contributes to an understanding of adaptations. The approach based on optimality mmodels in biology is sometimes called optimality theory.",

Skating for Roces skates from 1994 to 1998 then switching to K2 skates from 1999 to 2004. Born in Madrid, Spain, 3 February, and having lived most of his life in Sydney Australia, Cesar represented Australia also in soccer at a youth level, travelling to US and England before landing in his city of birth Madrid and training with professional Spanish side Rayo Vallecano for several months who at the time were in the 4th division of the Spanish league. He returned to Sydney and started skating at the beautiful Bondi Beach where he honed his skills on the ramp and launched himself on an international skating career that took him around the world and back several times.

The green troops of the 99th, along with the battle-tested 2nd Infantry Division, held a key sector controlling access to Spa and Leige and large repositories of ammunition, fuel, and supplies. Despite being outnumbered by German forces at least five to one, during the Battle of Elsenborn Ridge they did not yield. It was the only sector of the American front lines during the German offensive where the Germans failed to advance. Lauer was a veteran of both World War I and II.\r\nOperation Roland was a local German offensive inside the Soviet Union during the Second World War on the Eastern Front, and was conducted as a local operation within the overarching German summer offensive, Operation Citadel, on the southern side of the Kursk salient. The German forces of the III Panzer Corps and the 2nd SS Panzergrenadier Division Das Reich of the II SS Panzer Corps attempted to envelop and destroy Soviet forces of the Voronezh Front. This operation was necessitated by the failure of the German II SS Panzer Corps to break through Soviet forces during the Battle of Prokhorovka on 12 July. Therefore, German commanders decided to first link up the III Panzer Corps, which had been lagging behind due to heavy Soviet resistance, with the II SS Panzer Corps, in order to consolidate the German positions into a continuous frontline without inward bulges and enable the two panzer corps to overrun Soviet forces defending Prokhoravka together. The linking up of the two German pincers was planned to effectuate the envelopment of the Soviet 69th Army and other supporting units.\r\nThe 37th Field Artillery Regiment is a field artillery regiment of the United States Army, and parent regiment under the U.S. Army Regimental System. The regiment was first constituted 5 July 1918 in the National Army. The regiment served with the 10th Division during World War I, and the 2nd Infantry Division during World War II. Elements of the regiment have served with the 2nd Infantry Division, 6th Infantry Division, 79th Infantry Division, and 172nd Infantry Brigade, among other units. Two battalions of the regiment are currently active, the 1st Battalion, 37th Field Artillery is the direct support cannon battalion, in support of the 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division and the 6th Battalion, 37th Field Artillery is a Multiple Launch Rocket System battalion in the 210th Field Artillery Brigade.\r\nOperation Citadel (German: \"Unternehmen Zitadelle\" ) was a German offensive operation against Soviet forces in the Kursk salient during the Second World War on the Eastern Front that initiated the Battle of Kursk. The deliberate defensive operation that the Soviets implemented to repel the German offensive is referred to as the Kursk Strategic Defensive Operation. The German offensive was countered by two Soviet counter-offensives, Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev (Russian: \u041f\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0446 \u0420\u0443\u043c\u044f\u043d\u0446\u0435\u0432 ) and Operation Kutuzov (Russian: \u041a\u0443\u0442\u0443\u0437\u043e\u0432 ). For the Germans, the battle was the final strategic offensive that they were able to launch on the Eastern Front. As the Allied invasion of Sicily began Adolf Hitler was forced to divert troops training in France to meet the Allied threats in the Mediterranean, rather than use them as a strategic reserve for the Eastern Front. Germany's extensive loss of men and tanks ensured that the victorious Soviet Red Army enjoyed the strategic initiative for the remainder of the war.\r\nThe 16th Panzer Division (German: \"16. Panzer-Division\" ) was a formation of the German Army in World War II. It was formed in November 1940 from the 16th Infantry Division. It took part in Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, operating in the southern sector of the Eastern Front. After the Soviet offensive in November 1942 the division was trapped in Stalingrad, where it surrendered in February 1943. A new 16th Panzer Division was formed in 1943 and sent to Italy where it was part of the unsuccessful German defense against the Allied invasion of Italy. Sent back to the Eastern Front in November 1943 the division once more saw action in the southern sector, taking part in the relief operation of the Korsun-Cherkassy Pocket and being part of the Kamenets-Podolsky pocket. It eventually surrendered to Soviet and US American forces in Czechoslovakia in May 1945.\r\nThe 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division was an infantry division of the British Army that was originally formed as the Lowland Division, in 1908 as part of the Territorial Force. It later became the 52nd (Lowland) Division in 1915. The 52nd (Lowland) Division fought in the First World War before being disbanded, with the rest of the Territorial Force, in 1920. The Territorial Force was later reformed as the Territorial Army and the division was again raised, during the inter-war years, as the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division - a 1st Line Territorial Army Infantry Division - and went on to serve during the Second World War. After the war, the division was merged with the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division in 1948. The history of the division was carried on by the 52nd Lowland Brigade, and later the 52nd Lowland Regiment.\r\nThe Battle of Kursk was a Second World War engagement between German and Soviet forces on the Eastern Front near Kursk (450 km south-west of Moscow) in the Soviet Union during July and August 1943. The battle began with the launch of the German offensive, Operation Citadel (German: \"Unternehmen Zitadelle\" ), on 5 July, which had the objective of pinching off the Kursk salient with attacks on the base of the salient from north and south simultaneously. After the German offensive stalled on the northern side of the salient, on 12 July the Soviets commenced their Kursk Strategic Offensive Operation with the launch of Operation Kutuzov (Russian: \u041a\u0443\u0442\u0443\u0437\u043e\u0432 ) against the rear of the German forces in the northern side. On the southern side, the Soviets also launched powerful counterattacks the same day, one of which led to a large armoured clash, the Battle of Prokhorovka. On 3 August, the Soviets began the second phase of the Kursk Strategic Offensive Operation with the launch of Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev (Russian: \u041f\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0446 \u0420\u0443\u043c\u044f\u043d\u0446\u0435\u0432 ) against the German forces in the southern side of the Kursk salient.",
