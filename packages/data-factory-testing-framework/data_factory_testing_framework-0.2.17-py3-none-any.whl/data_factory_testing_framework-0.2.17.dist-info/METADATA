# Data Factory - Testing Framework :hammer_and_wrench:

A stand-alone test framework that allows to write unit tests for Data Factory pipelines on [Microsoft Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-factory/) and [Azure Data Factory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/concepts-pipelines-activities?tabs=data-factory).

> The framework is currently in _Public Preview_ and is not officially supported by Microsoft.

## Features :rocket:

The framework evaluates pipeline and activity definitions which can be asserted. It does so by providing the following features:

1. Evaluate expressions by using the framework's internal expression parser. It supports all the functions and arguments that are available in the Data Factory expression language.
2. Test an activity with a specific state and assert the evaluated expressions.
3. Test a pipeline run by verifying the execution flow of activities for specific input parameters and assert the evaluated expressions of each activity.

> The framework does not support running the actual pipeline. It only gives you the ability to test the pipeline and activity definitions.

### High-level example :bulb:

Given a `WebActivity` with a `typeProperties.url` property containing the following expression:

```datafactoryexpression
@concat(pipeline().globalParameters.BaseUrl, variables('Path'))
```

A simple test to validate that the concatenation is working as expected could look like this:

```python
    # Arrange
    activity = pipeline.get_activity_by_name("webactivity_name")
    state = PipelineRunState(
        parameters=[
            RunParameter(RunParameterType.Global, "BaseUrl", "https://example.com"),
        ],
        variables=[
            PipelineRunVariable("Path", "some-path"),
        ])

    # Act
    activity.evaluate(state)

    # Assert
    assert "https://example.com/some-path" == activity.type_properties["url"].result
   ```

## Why :question:

Data Factory does not support unit testing, nor testing of pipelines locally. Having integration and e2e tests running on an actual Data Factory instance is great, but having unit tests on top of them provides additional means of quick iteration, validation and regression testing. Unit testing with the _Data Factory Testing Framework_ has the following benefits:

* Runs locally with immediate feedback
* Easier to cover a lot of different scenarios and edge cases
* Regression testing

## Concepts :books:

The following pages go deeper into different topics and concepts of the framework to help in getting you started.

### Basic :seedling:

1. [Repository setup](docs/basic/repository_setup.md)
2. [Installing and initializing the framework](docs/basic/installing_and_initializing_framework.md)
3. [State](docs/basic/state.md)
4. [Activity testing](docs/basic/activity_testing.md)
5. [Pipeline testing](docs/basic/pipeline_testing.md)

> If you are a not that experienced with Python, you can follow the [Getting started](docs/basic/getting_started.md) guide to get started with the framework.

### Advanced :microscope:

1. [Debugging your activities and pipelines](docs/advanced/debugging.md)
2. [Development workflow](docs/advanced/development_workflow.md)
3. [Overriding expression functions](docs/advanced/overriding_expression_functions.md)
4. [Framework internals](docs/advanced/framework_internals.md)

## Examples :memo:

More advanced examples demonstrating the capabilities of the framework:

Fabric:

1. [Batch job example](examples/fabric/batch_job/README.md)

Azure Data Factory:

1. [Copy blobs example](examples/data_factory/copy_blobs/README.md)
2. [Batch job example](examples/data_factory/batch_job/README.md)

## Limitations :warning:

The framework has the following limitations at the moment:

1. The framework reimplements the Data Factory expression language in Python. This means that it might not be 100% accurate with the actual Data Factory language, especially when it comes to xml functions.
2. The framework does not support automatic type conversion of arguments passed to functions in expressions.

> These limitations are top priority to be resolved in the future.
