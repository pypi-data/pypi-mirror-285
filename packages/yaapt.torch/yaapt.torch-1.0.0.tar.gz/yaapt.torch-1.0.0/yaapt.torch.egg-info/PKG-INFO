Description: # yaapt.torch
        
        Implementation of the YAAPT pitch tracker in PyTorch.  
        This version relies solely on PyTorch, does not hog all CPU threads (making it possible to use in a dataloader),
        is torch.jit-able, and is batch compatible.
        
        ### Setup
        
        For using (no development required)
        
        ```bash
        pip install yaapt.torch
        ```
        
        To install for development, clone the repository, and then run the following from
        within the root directory.
        
        ```bash
        pip install -e .
        ``` 
        
        ### Usage
        
        ```python
        import torchaudio, yaapt_torch
        audio, sr = torchaudio.load("audio.wav")
        
        yaapt_opts = {
            "sr": sr,
            "frame_length": 35.0,
            "frame_space": 20.0,
            "nccf_thresh1": 0.25,
            "tda_frame_length": 25.0,
        }
        
        pitch = yaapt_torch.yaapt(
            audio, # (Batch, feature) torch.tensor input
            yaapt_opts,
        )
        print(pitch) # (Batch, F0) torch.tensor output
        ```

        This repository aims to wrap up these implementations in easy-installable PyPi
        packages, which can be used directly in PyTorch based neural network training.
