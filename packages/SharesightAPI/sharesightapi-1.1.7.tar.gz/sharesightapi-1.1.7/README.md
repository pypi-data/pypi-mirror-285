# **Sharesight API** #

API to interface with Sharesight's v2 API

- Currently only supports push requests
- Currently only supports as single portfolio request per instance called

# **How to use** #
See the pytest.py file for an example

This whole thing is designed to be asynchronous 

Added support for refresh token, no need to feed in clientID, clientSecret or authCode if token file exists

# **How to install** #
Do ```pip install SharesightAPI```

# **How to get API token** #

Read [here](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/api/) 

# **Input/Output** #

To start, call and assign (like this)

`sharesight = SharesightAPI.SharesightAPI(client_id, client_secret, authorization_code, redirect_uri, token_url, api_url_base, token_file, True)`

Sharesight has some recommendations for defaults as seen [here](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/api/2/authentication_flow):

Then; to get the existing data (optional), run this to get the values:

`await sharesight.initialize()`

+ redirect_uri = 'urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob'
+ token_url = 'https://api.sharesight.com/oauth2/token'
+ api_url_base = 'https://api.sharesight.com/api/v2/'

I have assumed some things (if left blank):

+ token_file = 'sharesight_token.txt'
+ debugging = False

Then to check the token (and to import it and gather credentials), run the .validate_token call, if it will return if the token has passed, failed and why. and will store the token in a .txt file

example:
`await sharesight.validate_token()`

To make an API call (get): call .get_api_request(endpoint, endpoint_list_version), making the endpoint being what part you want to call and the endpoint_list_version being ("v2" or "v3"). It will return a dictionary with the response

example: `await sharesight.get_api_request("portfolios", "v2")`

To make an API call (post): call .post_api_request, with the addition of parsing in a payload JSON to post

example: `await sharesight.post_api_request("portfolios", "v2", "{ "portfolio": { "name": "My new Portfolio"}}")`

you can see a full list of v2 endpoints [here](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/api/2/doc/index.html), and v3 endpoints [here](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/api/3/doc/index.html) (including examples)
