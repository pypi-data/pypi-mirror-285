# CheckModel

A simple set of classes to help you deal with geometry processing using IFC

> [!CAUTION]
> This is very unoptimized for medium and large models. Therefore, teh only current purpose is to allow the proof of concept in small models and help better understand the geometry processing of IFC models.

This CheckModel package is based on the usage of IfcOpenShell and Trimesh. Therefore, most of the methods used to execute the verifications are from these other libraries and I recommend accessing their documentation.

The package is also based on a olde version of the IfcOpenShell Selector that, as far as I know, is not available any longer with the same structure and syntax of when I written this few months ago. For this, I have included the older version of Selector in this package with some mods of mine as well.

Here you can still find some tips on the older Selector syntax >> https://wiki.osarch.org/index.phptitle=IfcOpenShell_code_examples#IFC_Query_Syntax
