SemiCart is an algorithm based on CART that uses the weights of test data to improve prediction accuracy. This algorithm employs calculation methods such as Nearest Neighbor and metrics like Euclidean and Mahalanobis distances to determine the weights, more infor: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13042-024-02161-z
