A class-based interface to the Galileo Flow Sensor

A Galileo-Flow SDK is a class based interface to easily communicate with the Galileo Flow Sensor. It contains essential modules to read the flow rate and do other necessary operations. 

**Setting up the GALILEO Sensor**

Setting up the Galileo Sensor is straightforward. First, insert the cartridge to the Base and power on the sensor using type-C USB connector. Make sure that all three flags on the screen are green.

Next, check the COMPORT number of the sensor. In Windows, you can open the Device Manager and find the COMPORT under Ports list:

**Example 1. Reading the flow rate**)
One can use the code snippet below to read the flow rate every second. But, instead of 'COM18',
do not forget to write the actual comport value.

```python
from GalileoFlowSDK import GalileoFlowSDK
import time

galileo_sensor = GalileoFlowSDK("COM18")
while(1):
    time.sleep(1)
    print('flow is ' , galileo_sensor.read_flow())
```

**Example 2. Reading the liquid type and changing it**

The code snippet below allows to check the liquid type in the Galileo Sensor
```python
from GalileoFlowSDK import GalileoFlowSDK
import time

galileo_sensor = GalileoFlowSDK("COM18")
print('liquid is ' , galileo_sensor.read_liquid())
```

To change the liquid, one can use update_liquid method. The argument ot this method is a number which cooresponds to
a liquid type:
-  0: water, 
-  1:ip, 
-  2:dmem, 
-  3:ethanol

For example, in the code below, we set ethanol as a liquid type:
```python
from GalileoFlowSDK import GalileoFlowSDK
import time

galileo_sensor = GalileoFlowSDK("COM18")
galileo_sensor.update_liquid(3)
time.sleep(1)
print('liquid is ' , galileo_sensor.read_liquid())
galileo_sensor.disconnect()
```

**Example 3. Reading the serial number of the Cartridge**
Every cartridge has its own unique serial number. This number is useful when utilizing several Galileo
Sensors to easily distinguish sensors from each other. In the interface, there is a function to read the serial number:

```python
from GalileoFlowSDK import GalileoFlowSDK
import time
galileo_sensor = GalileoFlowSDK("COM18")
time.sleep(1)
print('liquid is ' , galileo_sensor.read_serial_number())
galileo_sensor.disconnect()
```
