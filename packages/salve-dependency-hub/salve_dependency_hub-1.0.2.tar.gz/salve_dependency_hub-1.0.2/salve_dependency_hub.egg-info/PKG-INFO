# salve-dependency-hub

Provides Tree Sitter highlighting languages in one centralized place for usage with Salve IPC

Usage:
```python
from salve_dependency_hub import conversion_dict, language_mappings
```

Note that the only premade language mappings available at the moment are for python and Java as they were the only ones I had enough code to make decent mappings for. If you notice issues in any mappings, please raise an issue. If you want a premade mapping added, make a PR.
