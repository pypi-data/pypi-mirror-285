Mkdev creates directory structures based off of yaml
configuration files found in ${CONFIG}. you
can write these manually, or more simply generate them
using `mkdev edit`.

The general structure of a configuration file is a language
name, an extension for the file type, template files that
will be written to files, and a list of instructions to
build a directory structure.

The instructions should be one of three commands dir, ph, or
tmp and an argument that is a path separated by pipes ('|')
for different directories. The three commands correspond to
making a directory, an empty (placeholder) file, and a
template respectively.

For instance, the following makes a directory foo, and adds an
empty file to it called bar, and copies a template called bat.py
to the root directory of the project, giving the recipe the name
baz:

baz:
- dir foo
- ph foo|bar
- tmp bat

note that the argument to tmp is *not* the file name, but instead
whatever the template is named--in this case bat. That means one can
have multiple files called some name (Makefile, for instance) and
different template names associated to it (e.g., makefile1, makefile2)
