    longDescription: |
      The GNU Health project provides the tools for individuals, health
      professionals, institutions and governments to proactively assess and
      improve the underlying determinants of health, from the socioeconomic
      agents to the molecular basis of disease. From primary health care to
      precision medicine.


      **GNU Health is a Libre, community driven project from GNU Solidario, **a
      non-profit humanitarian organization focused on Social Medicine. Our
      project has been adopted by multilateral organizations to national public
      health systems around the world.


      ### The following are the main components that make up the GNU Health
      ecosystem:


      ​


      # GNU Health - Hospital Management (HMIS)


      **GNU Health HMIS component for Health Practitioners, Health Institutions
      and Governments.**


      Its modular design allows to be deployed in many different  scenarios:
      from small private offices, to large, national public health 
      systems.         It covers the functionality of Electronic Medical Record
      (EMR),  Hospital Management and Health Information System (HIS).


      GNU Health HMIS component is standard-based, and it provides over 40 
      packages/modules (primary care, obstetrics & gynecology,  pediatrics,
      surgery, lims, genetics, diagnostic imaging, reporting...)  to fit your
      institution needs. The GH HMIS combines the socioeconomic  determinants of
      health with state-of-the-art technology in  bioinformatics and clinical
      genetics. It manages the internal processes  of a health institution, such
      as financial management, billing, stock  management, pharmacies or labs
      (LIMS)


      ​


      # GNU LIMS - Laboratory


      **GNU LIMS, also known as Occhiolino, is a modern  Laboratory Information
      Management System for the healthcare and  biomedical sectors, that has
      emerged as a GNU Health sub-project.**


      The Laboratory Modules manage the request, creation and evaluation  of
      laboratory analyses. As far as the LIMS (Laboratory Information 
      Management System) functionality, GNU Health is very flexible. You will 
      be able to link it to the patient chart and to the financial management 
      of the Health Center

        

      # PHR - Personal Health Record


      **MyGNUHealth is the upcoming GH's Personal Health Record** application
      that integrates to the GNU Health Federation, focused on desktop and and
      mobile devices. 


      MyGNUHealth development uses the latest mobile and desktop  technology,
      such as Qt, KDE Plasma and the Kirigami framework.  MyGNUHealth Personal
      Health Record is a privacy-oriented PHR, that will  put the citizen and
      the patient in control of her health and medical  information. MyGNUHealth
      will boost and improve the interaction between  citizens and the health
      professionals, with up-to-date information on  demographics and medical
      information.


      ​


      # GNU Health Federation


      **The GNU Health Federation **allows to build  large, nation wide
      federated networks with thousands of heterogeneous  nodes. The GNU Health
      federation is revolutionary, and will provide the  community, the health
      practitioners, the research institutions and the  ministries of health to
      have much better perspective and precise  information on the individuals
      and their context.


      The GNU Health Federation project aims to build a community based, 
      federated health network among different regions and in a country, and, 
      why not, among countries around the globe. A federation can be as large 
      as you want. From a small regional federated network with several nodes, 
      to a large, nationwide health network with thousands / millions of 
      participating nodes.


      ​


      # GNU Health Embedded


      **Single-board Computers (SBC)** are devices with a  huge potential for
      the Public Health System when partnering with GNU  Health. They can
      provide real-time monitoring of vital signs in hospital  settings,
      retrieve information from laboratory instruments or be a  great Personal
      Health tracker. They are also a great resource for  research and academic
      institutions.

       

      # Social Medicine


      **GNU Health as a social movement**: GNU Health is  a social project with
      technology behind. It’s about Social Medicine and  delivering universal
      healthcare. It’s about social activism. One of the  main reasons that led
      me to create GNU Health were the tremendous  inequalities in access to
      healthcare. Over 20000 children die every day  from preventable, social
      diseases. To name a few : malnutrition,  contaminated water, child
      slavery, prostitution, war, malaria, HIV-AIDS,  tuberculosis, dengue and
      other neglected tropical diseases. These are  causes and/or results of
      social diseases, conditions that have a higher  impact and higher
      prevalence on the poor and the underprivileged.


      Studying and getting a deeper understanding on the living conditions  of
      people in rural areas and in urban ghettos around the world,  reinforced
      my intention to write a system that included the  socio-economic
      determinants of health and disease. Most of the time,  health (and the
      lack of) is determined by the environment, and biology  plays a lesser
      role. Proper nutrition, housing, sanitation, access to  education and to
      primary healthcare are key for the dignity, development  and health of the
      individual, family and society at large. I like to  summarize it as
      **“people before patients”**
