MyGNUHealth: The GNU Health Personal Health Record (PHR)
=======================================================================

MyGNUHealth is the GNUHealth Personal Health Record application for desktop
and mobile devices that integrates with the GNU Health Federation.

Installation
------------

The easiest way to get MyGNUHealth is by **installing the package from your favorite 
operating system / distribution**.
Many operating system distributions already ship MyGNUHealth. Using the
OS package is the best way to keep the latest version of MyGNUHealth installed.

In the case that your distribution does not ship yet MyGNUHealth, you can do a 
local installation with pip.

 $ pip install --user --upgrade MyGNUHealth

(Keep in mind some systems might have `pip3` instead of `pip`)


Technology
----------
MyGNUHealth is intended for Libre operating systems. (BSD, GNU/Linux..)
It uses the Kivy framework and can be installed in desktops
(such as XFCE, KDE Plasma, GNOME..) and mobile devices (e.g., PinePhone).

Because MyGNUHealth uses Kivy, it can be ported to the Android (AOSP) and other 
operating systems.


Development
-----------
The development of MyGNUHealth resides on **Codeberg** (https://codeberg.org/gnuhealth/mygnuhealth)

Tasks, bugs and mailing lists will be on health-dev@gnu.org , for development.

General discussion is done at health@gnu.org mailing list.
