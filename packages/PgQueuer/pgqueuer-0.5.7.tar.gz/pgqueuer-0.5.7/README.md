## PgQueuer

PgQueuer is a minimalist, high-performance job queue library for Python, leveraging the robustness of PostgreSQL. Designed for simplicity and efficiency, PgQueuer uses PostgreSQL's LISTEN/NOTIFY to manage job queues effortlessly.

### Features

- **Simple Integration**: Easy to integrate with existing Python applications using PostgreSQL.
- **Efficient Concurrency Handling**: Utilizes PostgreSQL's `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` for reliable and concurrent job processing.
- **Real-time Notifications**: Leverages `LISTEN` and `NOTIFY` for real-time updates on job status changes.

### Installation

To install PgQueuer, simply install with pip the following command:

```bash
pip install PgQueuer
```

### Example Usage

Here's how you can use PgQueuer in a typical scenario processing incoming data messages:

#### Start a consumer
Start a long-lived consumer that will begin processing jobs as soon as they are enqueued by another process.
```bash
python3 -m PgQueuer run tools.consumer.main
```

#### Start a producer
Start a short-lived producer that will enqueue 10,000 jobs.
```bash
python3 tools/producer.py 10000
```
