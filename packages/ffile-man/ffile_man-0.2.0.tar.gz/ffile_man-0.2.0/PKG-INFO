# Welcome to the FITS File Manager repository

The FITS File Manager (ffile_man) is a package developed to assist you in the management of large sets of image files. 
Using ffile_man, the data can be sorted into file groups, according to their purpose, like calibration and scientific data.
For that, ffile_man looks for the `DATE-OBS` and `OBSTYPE` keywords in the image header. 
The former is the timestamp in which the image was acquired and it is used to sort the images as a function of time. 
The latter is used to sort by the type of the observation.

In this article, we will give you the basics of how to start using ffile_man.

The first example will print all the files found in the folder.
The second will print the files with a timestamp greater than 2024-7-17T12:11:00 (isot).
