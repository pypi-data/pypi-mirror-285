`pfl` is a Python framework developed at Apple to empower researchers to run efficient simulations with privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) and disseminate the results of their research in FL. We are a team comprising engineering and research expertise, and we encourage researchers to publish their papers, with this code, with confidence.

The framework is `not` intended to be used for third-party FL deployments but the results of the simulations can be tremendously useful in actual FL deployments.
We hope that `pfl` will promote open research in FL and its effective dissemination.

``pfl`` provides several useful features, including the following:

* Get started quickly trying out PFL for your use case with your existing model and data.
* Iterate quickly with fast simulations utilizing multiple levels of distributed training (multiple processes, GPUs and machines).
* Flexibility and expressiveness - when a researcher has a PFL idea to try, ``pfl`` has flexible APIs to express these ideas.
* Scalable simulations for large experiments with state-of-the-art algorithms and models.
* Support both PyTorch and TensorFlow.
* Unified benchmarks for datasets that have been vetted for both PyTorch and TensorFlow.
* Support other models in addition to neural networks, e.g. GBDTs. Switching between types of models is seamless.
* Tight integration with privacy features, including common mechanisms for local and central differential privacy.

Results from benchmarks are maintained in [this Weights & Biases report](https://api.wandb.ai/links/pfl/5scd5f66).

## Installation

Installation instructions can be found [here](http://apple.github.io/pfl-research/installation.html).
`pfl` is available on PyPI and a full installation be done with pip:

```
pip install 'pfl[tf,pytorch,trees]'
```

## Getting started - tutorial notebooks

To try out `pfl` immediately without installation, we provide several colab notebooks for learning the different components in `pfl` hands-on.
`<TODO push notebooks to colab>`

Also available as Jupyter notebooks [here](https://github.com/apple/pfl-research/tree/develop/tutorials).

## Getting started - benchmarks

`pfl` aims to streamline the benchmarking process of testing hypotheses in the Federated Learning paradigm. The official benchmarks are available in the [benchmarks](./benchmarks) directory, using a variety of realistic dataset-model combinations with and without differential privacy (yes, we do also have CIFAR10).

**Copying these examples is a great starting point for doing your own research.**
[See the quickstart](./benchmarks#quickstart) on how to start converging a model on the simplest benchmark (CIFAR10) in just a few minutes.

## Contributing

Researchers are invited to contribute to the framework. Please, see [here](http://apple.github.io/pfl-research/support/contributing.html) for more details.
