# Epycs

Epycs is a simple way to convert shell scripts to python.
It features

  - A simple subprocess API
  - A sane behaviour of exiting by default on subprocess failures
  - A show-output-on-fail behaviour

The goal of this package is to be able to write shell-script equivalent code
in python while still being terse, but adding a tons of goodness in terms of
arithmetical expression, string manipulation, code reuse etc...

Say no to .sh and welcome .py with epycs, you'll thank me later.
