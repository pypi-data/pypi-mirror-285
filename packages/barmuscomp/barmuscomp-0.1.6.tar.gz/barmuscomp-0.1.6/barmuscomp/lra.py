    Return the Q matrix of NTD (barwise projection).

    Parameters
    ----------
    spectrogram : list of list of floats or numpy array
        The spectrogram to analyze, barwise.
    core_dimensions : list of integers
        The dimensions for each mode of the core tensor (number of columns for each factor).
    bars : list of tuples
        List of the bars (start, end), in seconds, to cut the spectrogram at bar delimitation.
    beta: float
        The beta parameter for the beta-divergence.
        Particular cases:
            2 - Euclidean norm
            1 - Kullback-Leibler divergence
            0 - Itakura-Saito divergence
        Default: 2
    init: "random" | "tucker" | "chromas" |
        - If set to random:
            Initializes with random factors of the correct size.
            The randomization is the uniform distribution in [0,1),
            which is the default from numpy random.
        - If set to tucker:
            Resolve a tucker decomposition of the tensor T (by HOSVD) and
            initializes the factors and the core as this resolution, clipped to be nonnegative.
            The tucker decomposition is performed with tensorly [3].
        - If set to "chromas":
            Resolve a tucker decomposition of the tensor T (by HOSVD) and
            initializes the factors and the core as this resolution, clipped to be nonnegative.
            The tucker decomposition is performed with tensorly [3].
            Contrary to "tucker" init, the first factor will then be set to the 12-size identity matrix,
            because it's a decomposition model specific for modeling music expressed in chromas.
        Default: tucker
    subdivision_bars : integer, optional
        The number of subdivision of the bar to be contained in each slice of the tensor.
        The default is 96.
    hop_length : integer, optional
        The hop_length used for the computation of the spectrogram.
        It is expressed in terms of number of samples, which are defined by the sampling rate.
        The default is 32.
    sampling_rate : float, optional
        Sampling rate used when computing the spectrogram (typically 44100Hz).
        The default is 44100.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy array
        Compressed matrix, of size (bars, compression_dimension).
