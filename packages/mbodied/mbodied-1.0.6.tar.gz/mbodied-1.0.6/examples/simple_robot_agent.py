"""Run a LanguageAgent with memory, optional remote acting, and optional automatic dataset creation capabilities.

While it is always recommended to explicitly define your observation and action spaces,
which can be set with a gym.Space object or any python object using the Sample class
(see examples/using_sample.py for a tutorial), you can have the recorder infer the spaces
by setting recorder="default" for automatic dataset recording.

For example:
    >>> agent = LanguageAgent(context=SYSTEM_PROMPT, model_src=backend, recorder="default")
    >>> agent.act_and_record("pick up the fork", image)

Alternatively, you can define the recorder separately to record the space you want.
For example, to record the dataset with the image and instruction observation and AnswerAndActionsList as action:
    >>> observation_space = spaces.Dict({"image": Image(size=(224, 224)).space(), "instruction": spaces.Text(1000)})
    >>> action_space = AnswerAndActionsList(actions=[HandControl()] * 6).space()
    >>> recorder = Recorder(
    ...     'example_recorder',
    ...     out_dir='saved_datasets',
    ...     observation_space=observation_space,
    ...     action_space=action_space

To record:
    >>> recorder.record(
    ...     observation={
    ...         "image": image,
    ...         "instruction": instruction,
    ...     },
    ...     action=answer_actions,
    ... )
