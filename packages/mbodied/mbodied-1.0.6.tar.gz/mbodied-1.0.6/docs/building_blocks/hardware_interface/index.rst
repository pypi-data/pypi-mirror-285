Hardware Interface
==================

Overview
^^^^^^^^^

Mapping robot actions from any model to any embodiment is very easy. In our example script, we use a mock hardware interface. We also have an `XArm interface <https://github.com/mbodiai/embodied-agents/blob/main/mbodied/hardware/xarm_interface.py>`_ as an example.

Upcoming: a remote hardware interface with a communication protocol. This will be very convenient for controlling robots that have a computer attached, e.g., LoCoBot.
