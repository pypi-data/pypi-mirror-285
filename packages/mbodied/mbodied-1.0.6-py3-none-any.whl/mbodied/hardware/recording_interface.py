    This class provides a framework for recording the state of a hardware interface, including
    its pose and captured images, at a specified frequency. It leverages a queue and a worker
    thread to handle the recording asynchronously, ensuring that the main operations of the
    hardware are not blocked.

    Subclass must implement the `do`, `capture`, and `get_pose` methods.
    Subclass should call the `do_and_record` method to execute the main operation and record.

    Note that we are recording the absolute pose of the hardware, not the relative motion.
