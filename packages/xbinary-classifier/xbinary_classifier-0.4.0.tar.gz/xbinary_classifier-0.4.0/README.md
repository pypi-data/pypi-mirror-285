# XBinary-Classifier
The XBinary-Classifier Package is a Python package designed to classify X-ray binary sources as either High Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXB) or Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXB). This package uses a pre-trained machine learning model to make the classification based on various features of the X-ray binary.
