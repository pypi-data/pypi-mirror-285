# Calculate Myerson values and explain GNNs

This package implements the Myerson solution concept from cooperative game theory. The Myerson values attribute every player of a game their fair contribution to the games payoff. Myerson values are related to Shapley values but the player cooperation is restricted by a graph.

A graph neural network (GNN) can be treated as a coalition function for a game and the Myerson values can be used as feature attribution explanations to understand a model prediction. This package also implements Methods to explain PyG GNNs with Myerson values.

Calculating the Myerson value scales exponentially with bigger graphs / more players. Therfore, Monte Carlo sampling techniques were implemented to approximate the Myerson values.

## Installation
Install the package with the following command:

```bash
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ myerson
```
