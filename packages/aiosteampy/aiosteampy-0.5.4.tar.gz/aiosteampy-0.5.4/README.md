Previously this library was a soft fork of [bukson/steampy](https://github.com/bukson/steampy) and created only to
provide asynchronous methods and proxies support.
But now it _standalone_ project. Created by myself for steam trading purposes mostly.

<!--intro-start-->

AIOSTEAMPY use [aiohttp](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp) underneath to do asynchronous requests to steam servers,
with modern async/await syntax.

> Generally, project inspired most
> by [DoctorMcKay/node-steamcommunity](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steamcommunity)

## Key features

- Stateless: the main idea was a low-middle layer API wrapper of some steam services and methods like market,
  tradeoffers, confirmations, steamguard, etc. But if you want to cache your entities data (listings, confirmations,
  ...) [there is some methods to help](https://aiosteampy.somespecial.one/examples/states/).
- Declarative: there is models almost for every data.
- Typed: for editor support most things are typed.
- Short: I really tried to fit most important for steam trading methods.
- Connection behind web proxy.

## What can I do with this

- Operate with steam trade offers for any manner.
- Sell, buy items on market. Place, cancel orders.
- Login trough steam to 3rd party sites.
- Fetch data from market.
- Manipulate many accounts with proxies for each session.
- Store and load cookies to stay logged in.
- Convert market prices into different currencies.

## What I can't do

- Chat (at least for now).
- Get apps, packages.
- All, that need connection to CM.
- Interact with game servers (inspect CS2 (ex. CSGO) items, ...).
- Edit profile, social interaction(groups, clans).
- Handle entities (listings, items, tradeoffers) lifecycle for easy if you need to store it.
