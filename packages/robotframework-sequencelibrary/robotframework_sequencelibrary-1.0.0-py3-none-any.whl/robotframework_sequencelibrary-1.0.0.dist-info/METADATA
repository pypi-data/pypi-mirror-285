[![GitHub Actions status](https://github.com/crsdet/robotframework-sequencelibrary/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/crsdet/robotframework-sequencelibrary/actions) [![Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/robotframework-sequencelibrary.svg?label=version)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/robotframework-sequencelibrary) [![License](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/robotframework-sequencelibrary.svg)](https://github.com/crsdet/robotframework-sequencelibrary/blob/main/LICENSE)

**RobotFramework-SequenceLibrary** is a [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org) library for running keywords in sequence. The purpose is to streamline the execution of common operations by providing a condensed syntax that allows users to perform tasks with fewer lines of code.

## Installation

You can install robotframework-sequencelibrary via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable):

~~~sh
pip install robotframework-sequencelibrary
~~~

## Usage

Documentation can be found at <https://crsdet.github.io/robotframework-sequencelibrary>.

~~~robotframework
*** Settings ***
Library             SequenceLibrary


*** Test Cases ***
Test Generate Random Int And Set A Test Variable
    ${num}                  Run Sequence
    ...                     Random Int              18                      100
    ...                     AND
    ...                     Set Test Variable       $RANDOM_NUMBER
    Variable Should Exist                           ${RANDOM_NUMBER}
    Should Be Equal         ${num}                  ${RANDOM_NUMBER}

Test Replace Last Returned Value
    ${num}                  Run Sequence
    ...                     Random Int              18                      100
    ...                     AND
    ...                     Set Test Variable       $RANDOM_NUMBER
    ...                     AND
    ...                     Evaluate                $_ + 10
    ...                     AND
    ...                     Set Test Variable       $RANDOM_NUMBER_PLUS_10
    Variable Should Exist                           ${RANDOM_NUMBER}
    Variable Should Exist                           ${RANDOM_NUMBER_PLUS_10}
    Should Be Equal         ${RANDOM_NUMBER + 10}                           ${RANDOM_NUMBER_PLUS_10}
    Should Be Equal         ${num}                  ${RANDOM_NUMBER_PLUS_10}

Test Last Returned Value Remains If Previous Keyword Does Not Return A Value
    ${num}                  Run Sequence
    ...                     Random Int              18                      100
    ...                     AND
    ...                     Log
    ...                     AND
    ...                     Set Test Variable       $RANDOM_NUMBER
    Variable Should Exist                           ${RANDOM_NUMBER}
    Should Be Equal         ${num}                  ${RANDOM_NUMBER}

~~~

You can also specify a different separator or replace string:

~~~robotframework
*** Settings ***
Library     SequenceLibrary    separator=${SEPARATOR}    replace=${REPLACE}


*** Variables ***
${SEPARATOR}    ->
${REPLACE}      %
