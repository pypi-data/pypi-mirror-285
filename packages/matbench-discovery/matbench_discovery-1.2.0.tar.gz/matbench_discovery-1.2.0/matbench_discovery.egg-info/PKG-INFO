> Disclaimer: We evaluate how accurately ML models predict solid-state thermodynamic stability. Although this is an important aspect of high-throughput materials discovery, the ranking cannot give a complete picture of a model's general applicability to materials. A high ranking does not constitute endorsement by the Materials Project.

Matbench Discovery is an [interactive leaderboard](https://janosh.github.io/matbench-discovery/models) and associated [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/matbench-discovery) which together make it easy to rank ML energy models on a task designed to simulate a high-throughput discovery campaign for new stable inorganic crystals.

We've tested <slot name="model-count" />models covering multiple methodologies ranging from random forests with structure fingerprints to graph neural networks, from one-shot predictors to iterative Bayesian optimizers and interatomic potential relaxers.

<slot name="best-report" />

Our results show that ML models have become robust enough to deploy them as triaging steps to more effectively allocate compute in high-throughput DFT relaxations. This work provides valuable insights for anyone looking to build large-scale materials databases.

<slot name="metrics-table" />

We welcome contributions that add new models to the leaderboard through GitHub PRs. See the [contributing guide](https://janosh.github.io/matbench-discovery/contribute) for details.
