software systems, and receive any explanations that may reasonably be
requested. MVTec shall be responsible for its costs incurred in
connection with any such audit, provided that you shall reimburse MVTec
for the cost of the audit if the examination discloses an underpayment
to MVTec of more than ten percent (10%) of the payments due with respect
to any applicable period. Any further rights of MVTec remain unaffected.
This Section 2.3 shall survive any termination or expiration of this
Agreement for a period of three (3) years.</p>
<p>You further agree that upon request from MVTec or MVTec's authorized
