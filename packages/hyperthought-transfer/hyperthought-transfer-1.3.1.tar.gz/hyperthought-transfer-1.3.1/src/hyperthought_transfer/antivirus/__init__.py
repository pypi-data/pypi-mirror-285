"""
Plug-in framework for antivirus scanners.

Built-in scanners can be accessed directly, e.g.
hyperthought_transfer.antivirus.McAfee.

There is also a plug-in framework that can be used to add scanners.
See the add method for adding scanners and the get method for getting scanners
once added.

All scanners must subclass hyperthought_transfer.antivirus.base.BaseAntivirus.

The get method will return an antivirus class, which can then be used to create
an object instance.
