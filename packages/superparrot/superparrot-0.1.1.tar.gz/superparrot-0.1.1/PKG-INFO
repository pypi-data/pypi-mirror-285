# parrot ðŸ¦œ

**parrot** stands for **P**rocessing **A**ll **R**apidly & **R**eliably **O**btained **T**Hz-traces.

parrot is a Python package to load, process, and plot continuously recorded THz data (alongside with position data of
a delay line), obtained with Electro-Optic Sampling (EOS), photoconductive antenna (PCA) receiver or similar
techniques.

The documentation of parrot is located [here](https://timvog.github.io/parrot/).

## How to install

Just enter (coming soon)

```python
pip install superparrot
```

(The name `parrot` was unfortunately already taken on pypi.org, thus the different name for `pip install superparrot`. However,
after installation the program can be imported as `parrot`.)

***

## How to use

If you have anaconda (or Python + Jupyter Notebook) installed, try the `Example.ipynb` notebook from the root directory.
If you prefer classic Python, checkout `Example.py` in the root directory. The distribution comes bundled with some
example data, which allows to see the capabilities of parrot.
