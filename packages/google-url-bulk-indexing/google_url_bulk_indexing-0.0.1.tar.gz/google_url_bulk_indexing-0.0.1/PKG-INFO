### As a Module

You can also use it as a module in your Python code.

```python
from indexing.main import authorize_credentials, submit_url, read_urls_from_excel

# Provide the path to the API key file
API_Path = "path/to/your/service_account.json"

# Provide the path to the Excel file
excel_file_path = "path/to/your/urls.xlsx"

# Authorize credentials
creds = authorize_credentials(API_Path)

# Specify the request type
requestType = "URL_UPDATED"  # or "URL_DELETED"

# Read URLs from Excel
urls_to_submit = read_urls_from_excel(excel_file_path)

# Submit each URL for indexing or deletion
for url in urls_to_submit:
    response_code = submit_url(creds, url, requestType)
    if response_code == 200:
        print(f"Successfully submitted: {url}")
    else:
        print(f"Error submitting {url}. Error Code: {response_code}")

```
