        Configuration
        =============
        
        No specific configuration is required.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        ### Create root directories
        
        To create root directories, follow this instructions:
        
        - Documents > Directories
        - Click create
        - Set "Is Root Directory"
        - Fill Model and category (which is optional but recommended under this module logic)
        - Save
        
        Root directories with same model and category as existing ones cannot be created. 
        
        After, these directories can be used as parent directories. 
        
        
        ### Create files
        
        With this module we add a wizard to add documents (dms files) to model instances. By default, it is added to `res.partner`,
        but it can be added in other model form views as well.
        Once in this form views with our assitant to add modules:
        
        - Click on "Add documentation"
        - Upload file, and fill file name and file root directory.
        - Click on "Add".
        
        The file will be saved in a model related directory (same record name, linked to record) under the selected rood directory
