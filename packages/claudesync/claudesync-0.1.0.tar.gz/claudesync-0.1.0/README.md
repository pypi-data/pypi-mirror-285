ClaudeSync is a Python tool that automatically synchronizes your local filesystem with Claude.ai projects.

## Installation

You can install ClaudeSync using pip:

```bash
pip install claudesync
```

## Setup

1. Create a `config.json` file in your working directory:
   ```json
   {
       "user_id": "your-user-id-here",
       "project_id": "your-project-id-here"
   }
   ```

2. Ensure you have your Claude.ai session key ready.

## Usage

After installation, you can use ClaudeSync as a command-line tool:

```bash
claudesync --session-key YOUR_SESSION_KEY --watch-dir /path/to/watch
```

### Parameters

- `--session-key`: Your Claude.ai session key (required)
- `--watch-dir`: Directory to watch for changes (required)
- `--user-id`: Override user ID from config
- `--project-id`: Override project ID from config
- `--delete-all`: Delete all project documents
- `--delay`: Delay in seconds before uploading (default: 5)

### Examples

Watch a directory and sync changes:
```bash
claudesync --session-key YOUR_SESSION_KEY --watch-dir /path/to/watch
```

Override config settings:
```bash
claudesync --session-key YOUR_SESSION_KEY --watch-dir /path/to/watch --user-id different-user-id --project-id different-project-id
```

Delete all documents in the project:
```bash
claudesync --session-key YOUR_SESSION_KEY --delete-all
```

Set a custom delay for file uploads:
```bash
claudesync --session-key YOUR_SESSION_KEY --watch-dir /path/to/watch --delay 10
```

## Features
