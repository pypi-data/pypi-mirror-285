## 📋 Q&A
### I'm using a Mac, why does the application sometimes not respond when I click on it?

The issue affects macOS Sonoma users running applications that use Tcl/Tk versions 8.6.12 or older, including various Python versions.  
When the mouse cursor is inside the Tkinter window during startup, GUI elements become unresponsive to clicks.

Solution:  
Update to Tcl/Tk version 8.6.13 or newer, which fixes this problem.   
  
For Python users, this can be done by:  
Using Python 3.11.7 or later, which bundles the fixed Tcl/Tk version.  
Using Python 3.12 or later, which already includes the fix.  
https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/

For other Python versions, installing Tcl/Tk 8.6.13+ separately (e.g., via Homebrew) and ensuring Python uses this version.

Here is the issue: https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/110218


### ImportError: No module named 'Tkinter'

This probably happens because the Tk library is not installed.

For Ubuntu or other distros with Apt:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

For Fedora:

```
sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
```

For macOS:

```
brew install python-tk
```

For Windows:

make sure to **check in the Python install the optional feature "tcl/tk and IDLE"**.
