SEGMENTATION_TEXT = """Tigers mostly feed on large and medium-sized mammals, particularly ungulates weighing 60–250 kg 
(130–550 lb). Range-wide, the most selected prey are sambar deer, Manchurian wapiti, barasingha and wild boar. Tigers are  
capable of taking down larger prey like adult gaur and wild water buffalo, but opportunistically eat much smaller prey, such 
as monkeys, peafowl and other ground-based birds, hares, porcupines and fish. They also prey on other predators, including dogs, 
leopards, bears, snakes and crocodiles. Tiger attacks on adult Asian elephants and Indian rhinoceros have also been reported. 
The Middle English tigre and Old English tigras derive from Old French tigre, from Latin tigris. This was a borrowing of 
Classical Greek 'tigris', a foreign borrowing of unknown origin meaning 'tiger' and the river Tigris. The origin may have 
been the Persian word tigra ('pointed or sharp') and the Avestan word tigrhi ('arrow'), perhaps referring to the speed of the 
tiger's leap, although these words are not known to have any meanings associated with tigers. There are three other colour 
variants – white, golden and nearly stripeless snow white – that are now virtually non-existent in the wild due to the 
reduction of wild tiger populations, but continue in captive populations. The white tiger has white fur and sepia-brown stripes. 
The golden tiger has a pale golden pelage with a blond tone and reddish-brown stripes. The snow white tiger is a morph with 
extremely faint stripes and a pale reddish-brown ringed tail. Both snow white and golden tigers are homozygous for CORIN 
gene mutations."""
