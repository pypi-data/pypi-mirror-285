"""
This module defines some useful atomic types for building more complex
data structures.

Except for `hexbytes` (which is just a hex-printing subclass of `bytes`,
these types are all fixed-sized, simplifying serializing and parsing, like
those used in `cbincode` (the slight modification to the `bincode` standard that
chik uses).

from .hexbytes import hexbytes
from .ints import int8, uint8, int16, uint16, int32, uint32, int64, uint64
from .sized_bytes import bytes32
