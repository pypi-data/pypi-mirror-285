Why was this forked?
====================
Originally forked from https://github.com/tehmaze/getent. This fork was created since 
 A) the original repository is now archived
 B) The package published to pypi has a broken setup.py, which leads to installation failure. This was due to the `file()` function being called on this very Readme. While the original repository reflects an update that uses 'read()`, the PyPi source has not been updated. This repository exists to republish to PyPI
