A mature GeoGraphix environment may contain dozens of projects* in various
states of neglect. Some may exist on Windows shares not managed by a project server,
thus making them invisible to the Discovery interface.

Use purr_geographix to easily locate and query any GeoGraphix project via a simple
Python API. It's the missing middleware for taming an unruly geoscience data environment.

---

* ### Dynamic discovery of projects (even "misplaced" projects)
* ### Simple Python API
* ### No license checkouts
* ### Well-centric exports to JSON:

```
- completion
- core
- dst
- formation
- ip
- perforation
- production
- raster_log
- survey
- vector_log
- well
- zone
```

---

* Each [GeoGraphix](https://www.gverse.com/) "project" is a semi-structured collection
  of E&P assets that interoperate with
  a [SQLAnywhere](https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/sql-anywhere.html)
  database. A typical mid-continent US project may contain a half million well records,
  hundreds of [ESRI](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home)-powered maps and thousands of
  files.

## Installation

`pip install purr_geographix`

## Usage

<img src="./docs/fastapi.png" alt="drawing" width="100"/>

purr_geographix is based on [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com "FastAPI").
Once installed, you can use the auto-generated Swagger API pages to test drive
the available routes.

Current (demo)
documentation:  [purr_geographix API Routes](https://rbhughes.github.io/purr_geographix/)

## Future

Let me know whatever you might want to see in a future release. Some ideas are:

* Structured ASCII (Petra PPF or GeoGraphix ASCII3) exports instead of JSON
* Full Text Search
* Auto-sync with your PPDM or OSDU store?
* Standardize a multi-project interface with Spotfire
