    Agents represent *prosumers* (buildings) that act in this World (by
    consuming and exchanging energy).

    This quantity is assumed to come from an important but local source,
    such as a windmill farm, or an hydraulic power plant.
    
    It is separated from the *national grid*, which is considered unlimited,
    but must be paid by agents. On the contrary, the smart grid's *available
    energy* is free, but limited, and agents must learn not to consume too
    much so as to let energy for others.

    Generator of energy for each time step, at the smart grid level.
    
    We recall that the smart grid locally generates an important quantity
    of energy accessible to all agents.
    
    In order to make this generation agnostic to the number and profiles
    of agents, the *energy generators* rely on the maximum energy needed
    by all agents.
    
    For example, consider 3 Households agents with a maximal need of 10kWh
    each. The maximum energy needed in the whole world will thus be 30kWh.
    A generator may produce between 80% and 120% of this maximal need, which
    means that in some cases, there is not enough energy for all agents, and
    they must reduce consumption (or risk preventing others from consuming),
    and in other cases, there is more energy than necessary, and they can store
    energy for later.
