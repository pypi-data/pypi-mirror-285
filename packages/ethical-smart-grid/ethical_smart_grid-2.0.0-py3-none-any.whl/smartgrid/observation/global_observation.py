    """
    Global observations of the World, shared by all Agents in the smart grid.

    Observations cannot be modified once created, to limit potential bugs.
    Global observations are not directly linked to a particular agent, but
    rather to the whole society of agents in the :py:class:`.World`, i.e.,
    in this smart grid. Thus, the measures are the same for all agents.

    To optimize computations, we thus create global observations only once
    each step. This is done through the :py:attr:`.last_step_compute` and
    :py:attr:`.computed` *class* attributes. We emphasize that they should
    **not** be accessed through an instance, as they are not relevant as
    observations, merely to *compute observations*.

    A global observation contains the following measures:

    hour
        The current hour in the simulated world. It is computed as a ratio
        between 0 and 1, and days are ignored by using a modulo.
        Specifically, assuming that the current time step is ``t``, the *hour*
        measure is computed as ``(t % 24) / 24``.

    available_energy
        The quantity of energy available in the grid, which is accessible to
        all agents. This is a large pool of energy, however they should avoid
        over-consuming it, and take an appropriate quantity so as to let
        other agents profit as well.
        This measure is normalized as a value between 0 and 1, from the *real*
        available quantity, w.r.t. the bounds of energy that could have been
        generated at this step. See the :py:mod:`.energy_generator` module
        for more details on energy generators, and their bounds.

    equity
        The equity of comforts between all agents in the grid, i.e., to which
        degree do they have a similar comfort. It is computed as a statistical
        indicator of dispersion named the
        `Hoover index <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoover_index>`_, which
        is a well-known tool in economy, originally made to describe income
        inequality.
        ``equity`` is computed as ``1 - hoover(comforts)``, such that 0
        represents a perfect inequality (one person has everything, the others
        nothing), and 1 a perfect equality (everybody has the same comfort).

    energy_loss
        The quantity of energy that was available to agents, but not used
        (i.e., neither consumed nor stored) at this time step.

    autonomy
        This measure represents the autonomy, or self-sustainability, of the
        smart grid. It is measured based on the transactions (i.e., selling or
        buying energy from and to the national grid), w.r.t. the total amount
        of energy exchanged within the grid (given, stored, consumed).

    exclusion
        The proportion of agents that have a comfort lower than half the median
        of agents' comforts. Such agents are said to be *excluded*.

    well_being
        The median of all agents' comfort. Using a median rather than an average
        reduces the impact of outliers.

    over_consumption
        The quantity of energy that agents have consumed, but was not
        originally available in the grid. We assume that the grid automatically
        bought this missing energy from the national grid.
        It is computed as the sum of energy consumed from the grid and stored
        from the grid, by all agents, minus the sum of energy given by all
        agents, and the energy initially available, divided by the sum of
        energy taken by all agents, to obtain a ratio between 0 and 1.
        If the measure is less than 0, we set it to 0.
