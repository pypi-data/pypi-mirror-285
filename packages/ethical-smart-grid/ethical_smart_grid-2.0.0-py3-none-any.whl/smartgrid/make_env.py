    Finds a data file from the data folder.

    The ``data`` folder can be either:

    - accessible through a relative path, e.g., because the source code was
      cloned (``./data/path/to/the/desired/file``).
    - accessible through imports, e.g., because the package was installed.

    How to access files in this folder depends on the actual case; this function
    (hopefully) solves this problem, by checking first whether the files are
    directly accessible (through relative paths). If they are not,
    :py:mod:`importlib.resources` is used to get a path to the file through the
    package.

    :param dataset: The name of the folder containing the desired file, within
        the ``data`` folder. For example, ``openei`` to access the OpenEI
        dataset. This dataset cannot be nested, e.g., ``dataset/subdataset``
        or ``dataset.subdataset`` will not work.

    """
    Defines a "basic" scenario, a helper method to instantiate a SmartGrid env.

    This method limits the available parameters, and hence, the possible
    customization. It is used to simplify the creation of an environment.
    This basic environment is configured with:

    * 20 agents with the *Household* profile, 5 agents with the *Office*
      profile, and 1 agent with the *School* profile.
    * A :py:class:`smartgrid.util.RandomEnergyGenerator` which provides
      each time step between 80% and 120% of the agents' total energy need.
    * The :py:class:`smartgrid.rewards.numeric.differentiated.AdaptabilityThree`
      reward function, whose definition changes at t=2000 and t=6000 (to
      force agents to adapt).
    * The default :py:class:`smartgrid.observation.ObservationManager` to
      determine observations from the current state of the environment.

    Users that desire full control over the environment creation, e.g., to
    experiment with various scenarii, should instead manually create the
    environment "from scratch", as explained in the documentation. They
    may take inspiration from this method's content to do so.

    :param rewards: The list of reward functions to use (see the
        :py:mod:`smartgrid.rewards` package for a list of available reward
        functions. Traditionally, most users will want to use a single
        reward function (*single-objective* reinforcement learning), but
        this environment supports *multi-objective* reinforcement learning
        if desired. By default, the :py:class:`.AdaptabilityThree` reward
        function is used.

    :param max_step: The maximum number of steps to simulate in the environment.
        By default, a maximum number of ``10_000`` steps are allowed; however,
        the environment can still be used after this amount, but it will raise
        a warning. This is mainly used to control the *interaction loop*
        automatically through the *terminated* and *truncated* values.

    :return: An instance of a :py:class:`.SmartGrid` env.
        This instance must be, as per the PettingZoo framework, ``reset()``
        before it can be used. The instance is wrapped in a
        :py:class:`.RewardAggregator` in order to produce single-objective
        rewards. To directly access the underlying env, use the
        :py:attr:`unwrapped` property.
