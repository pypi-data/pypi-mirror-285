"""
A few pre-defined scenarii to quickly launch simulations without coding anything.

These scenarii are, contrary to the rest of the code, not meant to be easily
extensible or flexible, just to provide a few pre-defined environment setups
that can be leveraged in a single import, rather than having to define them
"by hand". In this sense, they are by no means exhaustive.

They offer the additional advantage of serving as examples for writing your
own custom setups: please feel free to read their source code and copy-paste
at will!

It currently contains the following scenarii:

- :py:func:`~.small_daily_scenario` : Small neighborhood, daily profiles of
  consumption, using the OpenEI dataset.
- :py:func:`~.medium_daily_scenario` : Medium neighborhood, daily profiles of
  consumption, using the OpenEI dataset.
- :py:func:`~.medium_annual_scenario` : Medium neighborhood, annual profiles of
  consumption, using the OpenEI dataset.

(The "small + annual" is already handled in the "basic" (default) environment,
see :py:func:`~smartgrid.make_env.make_basic_smartgrid`.)

To use one of these scenarii, simply instantiate a new environment by
invoking one of the functions, and use this environment through the classic
interaction loop. For example:

.. code-block:: Python

    from smartgrid.scenarii import medium_annual_scenario
    env = medium_annual_scenario(max_step=10)

    done = False
    obs, _ = env.reset()
    while not done:
        actions = {
            agent_name: env.action_space(agent_name).sample()
            for agent_name in env.unwrapped.agents
        }
        obs, rewards, terminated, truncated, _ = env.step(actions)
        done = all(terminated) or all(truncated)
