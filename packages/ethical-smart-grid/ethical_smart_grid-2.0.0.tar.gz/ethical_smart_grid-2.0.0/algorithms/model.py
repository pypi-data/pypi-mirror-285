    A Model is a class that handles the decision-making.

    It must produce decisions (actions) for all agents in the environment.
    Using a single Model for all agents simplifies the use, e.g., it suffices
    to use ``model = SomeModel()`` and ``actions = model.forward(obs)``, instead
    of looping over all agents. However, it is not strictly necessary to use
    a ``Model`` in the interaction loop: for more complex cases, different
    models can be used together, or functions can be used directly to produce
    actions, etc.

    The goal of this class is to provide a standard API that other learning
    algorithms can follow, or at least take inspiration from, and to simplify
    the use of learning algorithms.
