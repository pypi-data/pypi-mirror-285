## Instructions

The package `pyDySP` includes two classes:

- The `Test` class provides methods to add, manage, and plot data from multiple channels. Transfer functions can also be produced and analyzed.

- The `Channel` class provides methods for signal processing, including baseline correction, filtering, and trimming. Plotting methods are also provided.

Detailed documentation on the available class methods is available [here](https://pydysp.readthedocs.io/)
