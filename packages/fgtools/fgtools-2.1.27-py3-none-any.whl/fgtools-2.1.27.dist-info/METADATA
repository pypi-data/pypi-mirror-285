# FGTools
Tools for creating, managing and editing FlightGear scenery, aircraft, â€¦

## Installation
_Note_: To run these scripts you need Python 3, Python 2 won't work. Recommended version is 3.10 as I only have that installed so couldn't test with any other versions - earlier 3.x versions should work, but no guarantee !

### Normal user / Official releases
The latest release of FGTools can be installed with `pip`:
```sh
pip install fgtools
```

### Developers
If you want to always have the latest bleeding edge code, or want to contribute, you should install from Git:

`git clone` this repo and put it in a place of your choice, say `/home/user/fgtools`:
```sh
/home/user$ git clone https://github.com/TheFGFSEagle/fgtools
```
Then, `cd` into the cloned repo folder and install the code:
```sh
cd fgtools
pip install -e .
```
To update the code, you'd run (from the same folder):
```sh
git pull
```
