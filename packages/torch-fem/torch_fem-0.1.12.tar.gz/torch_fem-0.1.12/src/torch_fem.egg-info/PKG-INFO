# torch-fem: differentiable linear elastic finite elements

Simple finite element assemblers for linear elasticity with PyTorch. The advantage of using PyTorch is the ability to efficiently compute sensitivities and use them in structural optimization. 

## Installation
Your may install torch-fem via pip with
```
pip install torch-fem
```

## Examples
The subdirectory `examples->basic` contains a couple of Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating the use of torch-fem for trusses, planar problems and solid problems. The subdirectory `examples->optimization` demonstrates the use of torch-fem for optimization of structures (e.g. topology optimization, composite orientation optimization).
