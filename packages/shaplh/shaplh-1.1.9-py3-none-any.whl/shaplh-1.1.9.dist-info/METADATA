# Shapley Hierarchical Models

'shaplyh' is an extremely fast implementation of OpenAI's hierarchical shapley trees. We've implemented a small modular footprint allowing users to build on top of already staged structures, which is particularly effective in interactive client-facing applications. This project is under active development with nightly builds uploaded. (consider releases < x.x.10 to be stable, containing no new features or breaking changes, only bug fixes).

Comprehensive docs imminent.
