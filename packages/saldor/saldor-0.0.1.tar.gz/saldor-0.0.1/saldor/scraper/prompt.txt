I am an experienced developer and I would like to make a basic web app.

I want the backend of the web app to be made in python. 

I want there to be a text box where the user can enter a url and a button to submit the url.

I want the backend program to recieve that url and send a get request for it. 
There will be various different web scraping approaches that will be stored in the backend.
I want a way to view the different results.

I am an experienced developer and I would like to make a basic web app. Here are the specific requirements:

Backend:

Use Python for the backend. Preferred frameworks: Flask, Django, or FastAPI.
The backend should handle various web scraping approaches such as BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, and Selenium.
The backend should receive the URL input from the user and send a GET request to fetch the webpage.
Frontend:

The web app should have a simple UI with a text box for the user to enter a URL and a button to submit the URL.
Display the scraping results on the same page below the input form in a readable format (e.g., in a table).
Functionality:

The app should provide different web scraping results based on the stored scraping methods.
Handle invalid URLs and errors gracefully with appropriate error messages.
Security:

Implement basic security measures like sanitizing user inputs and handling rate limits.
Storage:

Optionally store the scraping results in a database or in memory for future reference.
Authentication:

No user authentication is required at this stage.
Deployment:

Provide guidelines for deploying the app on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or running locally.
