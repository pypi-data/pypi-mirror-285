0.2.0 (2024-07-17)
------------------

* Added a new coembedding algorithm accessible via flag ``--algorithm auto``. This algorithm utilizes neural networks
  to generate latent embeddings, optimizing both reconstruction and triplet losses to improve embedding accuracy
  by learning intra- and inter-modality relationships.

0.1.0 (2024-02-12)
------------------

* First release on PyPI.
