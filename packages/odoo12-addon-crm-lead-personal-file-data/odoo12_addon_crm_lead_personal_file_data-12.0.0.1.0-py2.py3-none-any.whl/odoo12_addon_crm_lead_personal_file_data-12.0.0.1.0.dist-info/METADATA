This module adds a pending partner assignment root directory related to crm.leads model and personal data root directory related to res.partner model.
It also adds listeners to move pending partner assigment files from crm to their related partner, both when creating dms files to leads that already 
have a partner, or when assigning partners to leads that already dms files under a pending partner assignment directory.
