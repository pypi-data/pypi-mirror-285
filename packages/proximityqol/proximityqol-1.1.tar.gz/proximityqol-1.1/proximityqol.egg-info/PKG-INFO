# Proximity Analysis with ArcPy

Perform spatial proximity analysis using ArcPy with ease. This package provides a Python class `proximity` tailored for analyzing spatial relationships in GIS data, specifically designed for Urban Institute's Quality of Life (QOL) spatial variables.

## Installation

Install `proximityuri` from PyPI using pip:

pip install proximityui

## Usage

import proximityuri as P

# Example usage:
prox_analysis = P.proximity('TaxData2023', 'Pharmacy2024')

# Merge additional pharmacy data
prox_analysis.merge('Pharmacy', 'PharmacyUnmatched')

# Add a new field for residential proximity to pharmacy
prox_analysis.addfield('ResNearPharmacy')

# Summarize the results
prox_analysis.summarize('r', 'd', ProjectGDB)

# Export summarized results to a text file
prox_analysis.exporttxt(path, 'QOL_46_2023.txt')

## Methods

__init__(self, tax_parcel_feature_class, proximity_feature_class): Initialize the proximity class with the tax parcel feature class and proximity feature class.

merge(self, *feature_classes_to_be_merged): Merge proximity feature classes from multiple sources into one feature class for analysis.

addfield(self, new_field_name): Add a new field to the tax parcel feature class.

summarize(self, near_residential_output_table, housing_units_table, geodatabase): Summarize residential units near the proximity feature class and export results to a geodatabase.

exporttxt(self, output_directory, final_txt_name): Export summarized results to a text file in the specified directory.
