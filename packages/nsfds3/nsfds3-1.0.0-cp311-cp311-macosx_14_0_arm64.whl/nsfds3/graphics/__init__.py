"""
The `graphics` package provides some helper classes and functions to represent meshes graphically.

    * :py:class:`nsfds3.graphics.MeshViewer`: Graphical tool to visualize Mesh objects graphically.
    * :py:class:`nsfds3.graphics.CPViewer`: MeshViewer specialization adapted to ComputationDomains.
    * :py:class:`nsfds3.graphics.MPLViewer`: MeshViewer specialization adapted to libfds.cFdtd or hdf5 files.

The main viewer used in nsfds3 is :py:class:`nsfds3.graphics.MPLViewer`.

Example
-------

::

    from nsfds3.graphics import MPLViewer
    from nsfds3.utils import CfgSetup

    filename = 'reference.conf'
    cfg = CfgSetup(filename)
    with MPLViewer(cfg) as viewer:
        viewer.movie(view='p', buffer=False, probes=True)  # Make movie
        viewer.probes()                                    # figure with probe evolutions
        viewer.spectrogram()                               # figure with spectrogram
