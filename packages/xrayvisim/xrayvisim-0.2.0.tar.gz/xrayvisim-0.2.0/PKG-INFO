XRAYVISION is an open-source Python library for Fourier or synthesis imaging of X-Rays. The most
common usage of this technique is radio interferometry however there have been a number of solar
X-ray missions which also use this technique but obtain the visibilities via a different method.

Installation
------------

It is strongly advised that you use and isolated environment through python's venv, virturalenv, anaconda or similar.


**The name 'xrayvision' was already taken on PyPi so the package name is 'xrayvisim' e.g.**

.. code-block::

    pip install xrayvisim

Usage
-----
