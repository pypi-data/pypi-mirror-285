# VIVID

## What is Vivid?
Vivid is an open-source platform offering a suite of intelligent tools designed to support HR professionals in HR transformation, talent management, and total rewards. It's completely free and open-source, ensuring accessibility for everyone!

### CAUTION
Vivid is in the early development stages. Some features may be incomplete or evolving. Our documentation is a work in progress. New versions, which may include breaking changes, are released periodically. We provide migration guides, but transitions might require some effort. Proceed if you are comfortable with this environment.

## Design Goals

- **Modular**: Use only the components you need and customize them to suit your needs.
- **Efficient**: Optimize processes to save time and resources.
- **Collaborative**: Encourage community contributions and shared improvements.

## Vivid Examples

We are diligently working on developing comprehensive examples to demonstrate the capabilities of the Vivid platform. These examples will provide detailed insights into performing various analyses, showcasing the platform's extensive functionality and offering a stable starting point for users.

### Example in Progress

Given the complexity and scope of the Vivid platform, creating meaningful examples requires careful planning and thorough development. We are currently preparing foundational examples, which will include a Python script that initializes Vivid and runs a default analysis.

We appreciate your patience and understanding as we strive to deliver high-quality resources. Stay tuned for updates and new examples as we continue to build and enhance the platform.
