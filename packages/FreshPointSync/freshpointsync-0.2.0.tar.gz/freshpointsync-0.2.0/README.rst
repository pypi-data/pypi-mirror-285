tracking data from *my.freshpoint.cz* product webpages.

`FreshPoint <https://freshpoint.cz/>`__ is a Czech service providing vending
machines with healthy snacks, lunches, and desserts for companies.
Unfortunately, the company does not offer any public API for accessing product
data, such as availability and prices. FreshPointSync is here to help.

efficient web requests, optimal performance, and responsiveness.

ü•Ñ **Robust HTML Scraping**. FreshPointSync utilizes ``beautifulsoup4`` for 
comprehensive product information extraction from the webpage HTML content.

üìä **Advanced Data Modeling and Analysis**. FreshPointSync employs ``pydantic`` 
for modeling, analyzing, and serializing extracted data.

üîî **Event-Driven Handlers**. FreshPointSync implements the *observer pattern*

Minimal Example
---------------

The following example demonstrates how to fetch data from a FreshPoint webpage 
based on its specific location ID and print the location name, overall product
count, and the number of available products. The extracted data is then dumped
to a JSON file.

.. code-block:: python

    import asyncio
    from freshpointsync import ProductPage

    LOCATION_ID = 296  # from https://my.freshpoint.cz/device/product-list/296
    CACHE_FILENAME = f'pageData_{LOCATION_ID}.json'

    async def main() -> None:
        async with ProductPage(location_id=LOCATION_ID) as page:
            await page.update()

            products_available = [
                p for p in page.data.products.values() if p.is_available
            ]
            print(
                f'Location name: {page.data.location}\n'
                f'Product count: {len(page.data.products)} '
                f'({len(products_available)} in stock)'
            )

        page_data = page.data.model_dump_json(indent=4, by_alias=True)
        with open(CACHE_FILENAME, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            file.write(page_data)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        asyncio.run(main())
