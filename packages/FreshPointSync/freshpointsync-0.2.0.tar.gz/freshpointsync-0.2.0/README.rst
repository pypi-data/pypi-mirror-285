comprehensive product information extraction from the webpage HTML content.

📊 **Advanced Data Modeling and Analysis**. FreshPointSync employs ``pydantic`` 
for modeling, analyzing, and serializing extracted data.

🔔 **Event-Driven Handlers**. FreshPointSync implements the *observer pattern*

Minimal Example
---------------

The following example demonstrates how to fetch data from a FreshPoint webpage 
based on its specific location ID and print the location name, overall product
count, and the number of available products. The extracted data is then dumped
to a JSON file.

.. code-block:: python

    import asyncio
    from freshpointsync import ProductPage

    LOCATION_ID = 296  # from https://my.freshpoint.cz/device/product-list/296
    CACHE_FILENAME = f'pageData_{LOCATION_ID}.json'

    async def main() -> None:
        async with ProductPage(location_id=LOCATION_ID) as page:
            await page.update()

            products_available = [
                p for p in page.data.products.values() if p.is_available
            ]
            print(
                f'Location name: {page.data.location}\n'
                f'Product count: {len(page.data.products)} '
                f'({len(products_available)} in stock)'
            )

        page_data = page.data.model_dump_json(indent=4, by_alias=True)
        with open(CACHE_FILENAME, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            file.write(page_data)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        asyncio.run(main())
